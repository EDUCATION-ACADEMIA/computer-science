<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-You can connect two or more commands so that the standard output of one command is used as the standard input of another command. A set of commands connected this way is known as a pipeline. The connection that joins the commands is known as a pipe.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Redirection is done using either the “&gt;” (greater-than symbol), or using the “|” (pipe) operator which sends the standard output of one command to another command as standard input.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The | command is called a pipe. It is used to pipe, or transfer, the standard output from the command on its left into the standard input of the command on its right. # First, echo “Hello World” will send Hello World to the standard output.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The PIPE command is a powerful and flexible command that lets you issue commands and manipulate messages in a pipeline. Many of the functions available in the HLL environment as commands and service routines are also available through the PIPE stage commands.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-One of the most powerful shell operators is the pipe ( | ). The pipe takes output from one command and uses it as input for another. And, you’re not limited to a single piped command-you can stack them as many times as you like, or until you run out of output or file descriptors.
