<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-It is an arbitrary point from where the lines are drawn on each point of an object. If the cop is located at infinity, all the lines are parallel and the result is a parallel projection.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-In Perspective Projection the center of projection is at finite distance from projection plane. This projection produces realistic views but does not preserve relative proportions of an object dimensions.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-If the distance between the Centre of Projection (COP) to the projection plane is finite, the projectors are not parallel to each other. This kind of projections is called perspective projection.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Orthographic Projection: Observer at infinite distance from the object.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-In three-dimensional geometry, a parallel projection (or axonometric projection) is a projection of an object in three-dimensional space onto a fixed plane, known as the projection plane or image plane, where the rays, known as lines of sight or projection lines, are parallel to each other.
