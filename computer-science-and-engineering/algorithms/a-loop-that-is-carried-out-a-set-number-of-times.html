<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-A count-controlled loop is used when the number of iterations to occur is already known. Steps that are part of the loop are indented . Indentation is used to show which steps are to be iterated. In this example, the variable ‘count’ is used to keep track of how many times the algorithm has iterated.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-for loops are count controlled, meaning that you specify the number of times that you wish the instructions to be repeated. Here is an example of a for loop where the statements (inside the loop body, as shown by the indented code below) will be repeated five times.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-A loop that repeats a specific number of times is known as a count-controlled loop. Count-controlled loops are so common that C++ provides a type of loop specifically for them. It is known as the for loop.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Sometimes an algorithm needs to iterate steps a specific number of times. In programming, count-controlled loops are implemented using FOR statements . Python uses the statements for and range (note the lowercase syntax that Python uses):
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The Count-Controlled while loop In this while loop an action is repeated a given number of times. A counter variable is created and initialized to a starting value before the loop is started. The condition that is tested before each iteration of the loop is whether the counter has reached a predetermined value.
