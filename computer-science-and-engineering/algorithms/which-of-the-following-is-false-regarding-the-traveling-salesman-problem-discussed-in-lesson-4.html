<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Rather than focus on finding the most effective route, TSP is often concerned with finding the cheapest solution. In TSPs, the large amount of variables creates a challenge when finding the shortest route, which makes approximate, fast and cheap solutions all the more attractive.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Option 2: As said earlier The Travelling Salesman Problem is one of the known NP-hard problems, which means that there is no specific particular algorithm to solve it in given time complexity. The minimum expected time to obtain optimal solution is exponential of the polynomial function.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-One of the most popular methods for solving the traveling salesman problem is the linear programming method. This method involves solving linear equations to find the optimal solution.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The traveling salesman problem consists of a salesman and a set of cities. The salesman has to visit each one of the cities starting from a certain one (e.g. the hometown) and returning to the same city. The challenge of the problem is that the traveling salesman wants to minimize the total length of the trip.
