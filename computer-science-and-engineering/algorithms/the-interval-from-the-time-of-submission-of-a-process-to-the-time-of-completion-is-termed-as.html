<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Turnaround time (TAT) is defined as the total time interval between the time of process submission and the time of its completion.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Turnaround Time vs Response Time: Turnaround time is the amount of time elapsed from the time of submission to the time of completion whereas response time is the average time elapsed from submission until the first response is produced.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Burst Time The total amount of time required by the CPU to execute the whole process is called the Burst Time.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Therefore, the time required for a particular process to complete, from submission time to completion is called Turnaround time.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Answer: Execution Time: The serial runtime of a program is the time elapsed between the beginning and the end of its execution on a sequential computer.
