<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-False. To any given problem there are generally multiple solutions (or none at all, but you don’t need to worry about impossible problems–your professor probably isn’t going to assign you any; -) ).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-There is always a solution You may not believe it, but every problem can be solved. Of course the logical, mathematical, or cognitive problems will always have a correct answer, but what about those non-logical, non-linear problems?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-In this spontaneous video Craig explains that when we see challenges as “misalignments” rather than as “problems” we are more likely to find creative solutions. In fact, when we withhold judgement we find that there is always more than one solution.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Life’s problems come in all shapes and sizes, and yet did you know that there are generally only 4 possible solutions to anything life throws at you? Once you know the 4 possible options, choosing how to move forward becomes easier.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Given a problem, there may be more than one correct algorithms. However, the costs to perform different algorithms may be different. An algorithm is correct only if it produces correct result for all input instances.

</strong>
</p>
<p>Is it true that there is a solution to every problem? 
</p>
<p>
<strong> CONCEPT QUESTION- 2 :
</strong>
</p>
<p>Can there be more than one solution in every problem? 
</p>
<p>
<strong> CONCEPT QUESTION- 3 :
</strong>
</p>
<p>How many solutions does every problem have? 
</p>
<p>
<strong> CONCEPT QUESTION- 4 :
</strong>
</p>
<p>Is there only 1 correct algorithm that can be used as a solution for every problem why or why not? 
</p>
<p>

</strong>
</p>
<p>Do algorithms guarantee a correct solution? 
</p>
<p>
<strong> CONCEPT QUESTION- 6 :
</strong>
</p>
<p>Do you think it is possible to have different algorithms when solving a problem why or why not? 
</p>
<p>
<strong> CONCEPT QUESTION- 7 :
</strong>
</p>
<p>Who said there are three solutions to every problem? 
</p>
<p>
<strong> CONCEPT QUESTION- 8 :
</strong>
</p>
<p>What are the 4 solutions to every problem? 
</p>
<p>
<strong> CONCEPT QUESTION- 9 :
