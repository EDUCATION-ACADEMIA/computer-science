<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Sequential computing is a computational model in which operations are performed in order one at a time. Parallel computing is a computational model where the program is broken into multiple smaller sequential computing operations, some of which are performed simultaneously.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-In parallel computing, the program is broken into smaller steps, some of which are performed at the same time. Modern computers have multiple processors (2, 4, or 8) in a single computer, so you can do small-scale parallel processing on the machine on your desk.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Which is true of sequential computing? There are multiple processors running at the same time. Tasks are completed in a random order. It can be easier to locate errors in programs using this processing method.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-These two terms are used with some overlap, but usually a parallel system is one in which the processors are closely connected, while a distributed system has processors that are more independent of each other.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Distributed computing is a model in which components of a software system are shared among multiple computers or nodes. Even though the software components may be spread out across multiple computers in multiple locations, theyâ€™re run as one system. This is done to improve efficiency and performance.
