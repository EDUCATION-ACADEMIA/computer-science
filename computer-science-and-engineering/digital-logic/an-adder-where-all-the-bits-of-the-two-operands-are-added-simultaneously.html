<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-It is done by a 1 bit flip flop and several shift registers and pair of bits added simultaneously during each clock cycle.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-A binary parallel adder is a digital circuit that adds two binary numbers in parallel form and produces the arithmetic sum of those numbers in parallel form. It consists of full adders connected in a chain, with the output carry from each full-adder connected to the input carry of the next full-adder in the chain.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-A single full adder performs the addition of two one bit numbers and an input carry. But a Parallel Adder is a digital circuit capable of finding the arithmetic sum of two binary numbers that is greater than one bit in length by operating on corresponding pairs of bits in parallel.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Serial binary adder. The serial binary adder or bit-serial adder is a digital circuit that performs binary addition bit by bit.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-There is a distinction between parallel adder vs serial adder. Both are binary adders, of course, since are used on bit-represented numbers. Parallel adder is a combinatorial circuit (not clocked, does not have any memory and feedback) adding every bit position of the operands in the same time.
