This state is also known as an Invalid state as the system goes into an unexpected situation.S=1, R=1 is state forbidden in SR flip flop. The flip flop does not get damaged in forbidden state (S=R=1).

Otherwise, making S=1 and R=0 sets the multivibrator so that Q=1 and not-Q=0. Conversely, making R=1 and S=0 resets the multivibrator in the opposite state.When using static gates as building blocks, the most fundamental latch is the simple SR latch, where S and R stand for set and reset.

<p>(D) ** S=1, R=1

<div style ="text-align:center">
<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Hence, in SR latch S = 1 and R = 1 is not a valid state.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Explanation: In a NAND based S-R latch, If S’=0 &amp; R’=0 then both the outputs (i.e. Q &amp; Q’) goes HIGH and this condition is called an ambiguous/forbidden state. This state is also known as an Invalid state as the system goes into an unexpected situation.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-S=1, R=1 is state forbidden in SR flip flop. The flip flop does not get damaged in forbidden state (S=R=1). It is called forbidden because there is no definitive gurantee of a fixed output.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-For this reason, having both S and R equal to 1 is called an invalid or illegal state for the S-R multivibrator. Otherwise, making S=1 and R=0 “sets” the multivibrator so that Q=1 and not-Q=0. Conversely, making R=1 and S=0 “resets” the multivibrator in the opposite state.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-When using static gates as building blocks, the most fundamental latch is the simple SR latch, where S and R stand for set and reset. It can be constructed from a pair of cross-coupled NOR logic gates. The stored bit is present on the output marked Q.
