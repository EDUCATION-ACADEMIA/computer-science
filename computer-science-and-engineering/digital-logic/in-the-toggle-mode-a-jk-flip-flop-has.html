<meta name="description" content="When J and K are tied together or set at 1 then the present state is equal to the previous state and gets complimented that 0 becomes 1 or 1 becomes 0. Therefore, a J-K flip flop made to toggle ? is J=1, K=1. Hence, option (D) is the correct answer.How is a J-K flip-flop made to toggle? Explanation: When j=k=1 then the race condition is occurs that means both output wants to be HIGH. Hence, there is toggle condition is occurs, where 0 becomes 1 and 1 becomes 0.J represents SET, and K represents CLEAR. In the JK flip-flop, the S input is known as the J input, and the R input is known as the K input. The output of the JK flip-flop does not modify if both J and K are 0. If both the inputs are 1, then the output dial to its free.However, if both the J and K inputs are HIGH at logic 1 (J = K = 1), when the clock input goes HIGH, the circuit will toggle as its outputs switch and change state complementing each other. This results in the JK flip-flop acting more like a T-type toggle flip-flop when both terminals are HIGH.The master flip flop toggles on the clocks positive transition when the inputs J and K set to 1. At that time, the slave flip flop toggles on the clocks negative transition. The flip flop will be disabled, and Q remains unchanged when both the inputs of the JK flip flop set to 0.">

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-When J and K are tied together or set at 1 then the present state is equal to the previous state and gets complimented that 0 becomes 1 or 1 becomes 0. Therefore, a J-K flip flop made to toggle ? is J=1, K=1. Hence, option (D) is the correct answer.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-How is a J-K flip-flop made to toggle? Explanation: When j=k=1 then the race condition is occurs that means both output wants to be HIGH. Hence, there is toggle condition is occurs, where 0 becomes 1 and 1 becomes 0.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-J represents SET, and ‘K’ represents CLEAR. In the JK flip-flop, the ‘S’ input is known as the ‘J’ input, and the ‘R’ input is known as the ‘K’ input. The output of the JK flip-flop does not modify if both ‘J’ and ‘K’ are ‘0’. If both the inputs are ‘1’, then the output dial to its free.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-However, if both the J and K inputs are HIGH at logic “1” (J = K = 1), when the clock input goes HIGH, the circuit will “toggle” as its outputs switch and change state complementing each other. This results in the JK flip-flop acting more like a T-type toggle flip-flop when both terminals are “HIGH”.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The master flip flop toggles on the clock’s positive transition when the inputs J and K set to 1. At that time, the slave flip flop toggles on the clock’s negative transition. The flip flop will be disabled, and Q remains unchanged when both the inputs of the JK flip flop set to 0.
