<strong> The algorithm implemented in a stack is? 
</strong>
<p>(A) FIFO-the first element must come out first from the list 
</p>
<p>(B) WIFI-the worst element must be the first to come in to the list 
</p>
<p>(C) ** LIFO-the last element must be the first to come out from the list 
</p>
<p>(D) all of the above 
</p>

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-LIFO is an abbreviation for last in, first out. It is a method for handling data structures where the first element is processed last and the last element is processed first.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Last-In-First-Out In a LIFO data structure, the newest element added to the container will be processed first. Sometimes this will be called a stack and is usually pictured as below. The new element is always added at the end of the stack.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-A stack follows the LIFO (Last In First Out) principle, i.e., the element inserted at the last is the first element to come out. The insertion of an element into the stack is called push operation, and the deletion of an element from the stack is called pop operation.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-LIFO is an abbreviation for Last in, first out is the same as first in, last out (FILO). It is a method for handling data structures where the last element is processed first and the first element is processed last.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Stack follows LIFO (last in, first out) order or approach in which the operations are performed.
