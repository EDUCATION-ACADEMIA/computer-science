<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Explanation: The answer is Queue. Queue is a data structure in which insertion takes place from one end, and deletion takes place from one end.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Enqueue()-Insertion of elements to the queue. Dequeue()-Removal of elements from the queue. Peek()-Acquires the data element available at the front node of the queue without deleting it. isFull()-Validates if the queue is full.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-It has two operations enqueue and dequeue. Enqueue is used to insert the element and dequeue is used to delete the element from the queue.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The insertion of an element in a queue is called an enqueue operation and the deletion of an element is called a dequeue operation.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-A queue is a linear data structure in which an element is inserted only at one end of the queue and deletion only at other end of the queue. A queue is based on first in first out (FIFO) property i.e. element inserted first will be the first one to be deleted.
