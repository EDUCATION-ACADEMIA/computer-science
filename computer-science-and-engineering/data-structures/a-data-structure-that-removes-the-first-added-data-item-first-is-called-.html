<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The operations of a queue make it a first-in-first-out (FIFO) data structure. In a FIFO data structure, the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-A queue is a First-In First-Out (FIFO) data structure, commonly used in situations where you want to process items in the order they are created or queued. It is considered a limited access data structure since you are restricted to removing the oldest element first.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-A queue is a data structure of ordered entries such that entries can be inserted at one end (called the rear) and removed from the other end (called the front). Since a queue inserts an item at the rear and removes an item from the front, this means that the first item into the queue is the first one removed.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-It is also known as “first-come first-served.” The simplest example of a queue is the typical line that we all participate in from time to time. We wait in a line for a movie, we wait in the check-out line at a grocery store, and we wait in the cafeteria line (so that we can pop the tray stack).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-In a queue elements can be inserted through REAR and removed through FRONT end. Therefore the elements will be removed in the same order as they are inserted. Those whatever the elements inserted first, is the first element to be removed. That’s why Queue is called as first-in, first-out (FIFO) structure.
