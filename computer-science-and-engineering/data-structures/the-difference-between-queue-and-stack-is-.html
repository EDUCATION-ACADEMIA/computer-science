</p>
<p>(B) stack requires dynamic memory but queue do not

<p>(D) stack use two ends of the structure, queue use only one

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-A stack uses one end known as a top for insertion and deletion whereas a queue uses two ends front and rear for insertion and deletion. Both stacks and queues store only similar kinds of elements. The insertion operation in a stack is known as push, whereas a deletion operation is known as pop.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The primary difference between Stack and Queue Data Structures is that Stack follows LIFO while Queue follows FIFO data structure type. LIFO refers to Last In First Out. It means that when we put data in a Stack, it processes the last entry first. Conversely, FIFO refers to First In First Out.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-One difference between a queue and a stack is: Queues use two ends of the structure; stacks use only one. If the characters ‘D’, ‘C’, ‘B’, ‘A’ are placed in a queue (in that order), and then removed one at a time, in what order will they be removed?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Stacks use two ends of the structure, queues use only one.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Unlike stacks, a queue is open at both its ends. One end is always used to insert data (enqueue) and the other is used to remove data (dequeue).
