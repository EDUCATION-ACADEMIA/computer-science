<strong> Which of these is an advantage of a dynamic data structure? 
</strong>
<p>(A) ** It makes efficient use of memory, using only as much memory as it needs 
</p>
<p>(B) It will overflow if it exceeds its allocated memory 
</p>
<p>(C) It allocates memory to pointers to keep track of where things are 
</p>
<p>(D) The memory allocation is fixed so there is no need to check size when adding and removing data items

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-A dynamic data structure has a dynamic size, that is, its size can grow and shrink based on the elements present in it at runtime. It makes efficient use of memory by using only that amount of space in memory that is required at any time.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Arrays. An array is a linear data structure that holds an ordered collection of values. Itâ€™s the most efficient in storing and accessing a sequence of objects.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Advantages of Dynamic Memory allocation This allocation method has no memory wastage. The memory allocation is done at run time. Memory size can be changed based on the requirements of the dynamic memory allocation. If memory is not required, it can be freed.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Index-based access to elements is fast and efficient since the address of the element is known. Dynamic data structures, on the other hand, have a variable size and are allocated at run-time. This means that their memory size can be changed during program execution.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-A Bloom filter [1] is a space-efficient approximate data structure. It can be used if not even a well-loaded hash table fits in memory and we need constant read access.
