<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-A weighted graph is a graph where each edge has a numerical value called a weight. Given below is an example of a weighted graph: The graph consists of five nodes and seven edges. Each edge has a weight.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Definition: A graph having a weight, or number, associated with each edge. Some algorithms require all weights to be nonnegative, integral, positive, etc. Also known as edge-weighted graph.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The weight of a node is the sum of the weights of the edges connected to the node. The weight of every node is calculated and then the highest weight node is determined. The complexity of finding the weights of the nodes is N^2 . We start at the highest weight node as the cluster and then grow it larger.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Weighted graphs are the graph data structures in which the edges are given some weight or value based on the type of graph we are representing. Unweighted graphs are the graph data structure which are not associated with any weight or value.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-A directed graph or digraph is a graph in which edges have orientations. In one restricted but very common sense of the term, a directed graph is an ordered pair comprising:, a set of vertices (also called nodes or points);
