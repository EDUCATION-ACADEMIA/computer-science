<meta name="description" content="A queue is a First-In First-Out (FIFO) data structure, commonly used in situations where you want to process items in the order they are created or queued. It is considered a limited access data structure since you are restricted to removing the oldest element first.It is also known as first-come first-served. The simplest example of a queue is the typical line that we all participate in from time to time. We wait in a line for a movie, we wait in the check-out line at a grocery store, and we wait in the cafeteria line (so that we can pop the tray stack).The rule used for a queue is to always remove the item that has been in the collection the most amount of time. This policy is known as first-in-first-out or FIFO. The rule used for a stack is to always remove the item that has been in the collection the least amount of time.A queue is a first-in first-out (FIFO) abstract data type that is heavily used in computing. Uses for queues involve anything where you want things to happen in the order that they were called, but where the computer cant keep up to speed.">

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-A queue is a First-In First-Out (FIFO) data structure, commonly used in situations where you want to process items in the order they are created or queued. It is considered a limited access data structure since you are restricted to removing the oldest element first.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-It is also known as “first-come first-served.” The simplest example of a queue is the typical line that we all participate in from time to time. We wait in a line for a movie, we wait in the check-out line at a grocery store, and we wait in the cafeteria line (so that we can pop the tray stack).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The rule used for a queue is to always remove the item that has been in the collection the most amount of time. This policy is known as first-in-first-out or FIFO. The rule used for a stack is to always remove the item that has been in the collection the least amount of time.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-A queue is a first-in first-out (FIFO) abstract data type that is heavily used in computing. Uses for queues involve anything where you want things to happen in the order that they were called, but where the computer can’t keep up to speed.
