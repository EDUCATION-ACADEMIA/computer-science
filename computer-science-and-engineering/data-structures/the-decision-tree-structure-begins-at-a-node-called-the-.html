<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Decision trees have three main parts: a root node, leaf nodes and branches. The root node is the starting point of the tree, and both root and leaf nodes contain questions or criteria to be answered. Branches are arrows connecting nodes, showing the flow from question to answer.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The Root Node: Is the node that starts the graph. In a normal decision tree it evaluates the variable that best splits the data. Intermediate nodes: These are nodes where variables are evaluated but which are not the final nodes where predictions are made.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Root Node: A root node is at the beginning of a tree. It represents entire population being analyzed. From the root node, the population is divided according to various features, and those sub-groups are split in turn at each decision node under the root node.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The first node of the tree is called the root . If this root node is connected by another node, the root is then a parent node and the connected node is a child . All Tree nodes are connected by links called edges .
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Decision Tree Terminologies Root Node: Root node is from where the decision tree starts. It represents the entire dataset, which further gets divided into two or more homogeneous sets. Leaf Node: Leaf nodes are the final output node, and the tree cannot be segregated further after getting a leaf node.
