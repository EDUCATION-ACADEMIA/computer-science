<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Tra versal of a graph is different than tree because. Answer: A. There can be a loop in the graph Explanation: You need to maintain an array to keep track of the vertices already visited.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-A graph is a set of vertices/nodes and edges. A tree is a set of nodes and edges. In the graph, there is no unique node which is known as root. In a tree, there is a unique node which is known as root.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The only difference between tree search and graph search is that tree search does not need to store the explored set, because we are guaranteed never to attempt to visit the same state twice. Breadth-first search: Run the generic graph search algorithm with the frontier stored as a (LIFO) queue.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Graphs are more complicated as it can have loops and self-loops. In contrast, trees are simple as compared to the graph. The tree is traversed using pre-order, in-order and post-order techniques. On the other hand, for graph traversal, we use BFS (Breadth First Search) and DFS (Depth First Search).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The only difference between a graph and a tree is cycle. A graph may contain cycles, a tree cannot. So when you’re going to implement a search algorithm on a tree, you don’t need to consider the existence of cycles, but when working with an arbitrary graph, you’ll need to consider them.
