<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-In mathematics, graph theory is the study of graphs, which are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects. A graph in this context is made up of vertices (also called nodes or points) which are connected by edges (also called links or lines).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Euler Graph-A connected graph G is called an Euler graph, if there is a closed trail which includes every edge of the graph G. Euler Path-An Euler path is a path that uses every edge of a graph exactly once. An Euler path starts and ends at different vertices.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Definition. A bipartite graph is one whose vertices, V, can be divided into two independent sets, V1 and V2, and every edge of the graph connects one vertex in V1 to one vertex in V2 (Skiena 1990). If every vertex of V1 is connected to every vertex of V2 the graph is called a complete bipartite graph.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-In discrete mathematics, a graph is a collection of points, called vertices, and lines between those points, called edges. There are many different types of graphs, such as connected and disconnected graphs, bipartite graphs, weighted graphs, directed and undirected graphs, and simple graphs.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-a linear or non-linear relationship, a positive (direct) or negative (inverse) relationship, the concentration or spread of data points, the presence of outliers.
