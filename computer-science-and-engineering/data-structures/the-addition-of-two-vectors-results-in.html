<strong> The addition of two vectors results in

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The triangle law of the addition of vectors states that two vectors can be added together by placing them together in such a way that the first vector’s head joins the tail of the second vector. Thus, by joining the first vector’s tail to the head of the second vector, we can obtain the resultant sum vector.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The resultant is the vector sum of two or more vectors. It is the result of adding two or more vectors together.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-To add the vectors (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂), we add the corresponding components from each vector: (x₁+x₂, y₁+y₂). Here’s a concrete example: the sum of (2, 4) and (1, 5) is (2+1, 4+5), which is (3, 9).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The resultant is determined by adding together these two the components to form a right triangle that has a hypotenuse that is equal to the resultant.
