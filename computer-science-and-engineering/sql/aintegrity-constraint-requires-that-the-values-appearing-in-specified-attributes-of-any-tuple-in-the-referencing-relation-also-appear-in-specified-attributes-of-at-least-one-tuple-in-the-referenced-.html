<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-A Referential integrity constraint requires that the values appearing in specified attributes of any tuple in the referencing relation also appear in specified attributes of at least one tuple in the referenced relation.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-A referential integrity constraint requires that the values appearing in specied attributes of any tuple in the referencing relation also appear in specied attributes of at least one tuple in the referenced relation. In above table, DeptNo is the primary key of Dept and it is foreign key of EMP table.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Foreign Key Constraint OR Referential Integrity constraint.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Integrity constraints in DBMS are used to ensure that data is consistent and accurate. There are four main types of integrity constraints: domain, entity, referential, and key.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Referential Integrity is used to maintain the consistency among tuples of the two relations. The referential integrity constraint states that a tuple in one relation that refers to another relation must refer to an existing tuple in that relation.
