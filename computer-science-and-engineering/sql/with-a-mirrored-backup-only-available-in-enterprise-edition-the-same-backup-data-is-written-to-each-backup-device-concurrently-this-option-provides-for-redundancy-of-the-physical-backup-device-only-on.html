<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Differential Backup This type of backup involves backing up data that was created or changed since the last full backup. To put it simply, a full backup is done initially, and then subsequent backups are run to include all the changes made to the files and folders.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Incremental backups Because an incremental backup will only copy data since the last backup of any type, an organization may run it as often as desired, with only the most recent changes stored. The benefit of an incremental backup is that it copies a smaller amount of data than a full.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-A full image backup, or mirror backup, is an exact replica of everything on your computerâ€™s hard drive, from the operating system, boot information, apps, and hidden files to your preferences and settings. Imaging software not only captures individual files, but everything you need to get your system running again.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Incremental Backups During an incremental backup operation, all specified files have their archive bit examined. If the bit is set, the file is backed up, and then the bit is cleared. This backup type is used to back up data that has changed or been created since the last full (normal) or incremental backup.
