<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The results of executing instructions are placed in the main memory. The instructions are transferred from the main memory and stored temporarily in small memories within the CPU called registers.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The result generated by the operation is stored in the main memory or sent to an output device. Based on the feedback from the ALU, the PC may be updated to a different address from which the next instruction will be fetched.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-An instruction, stored in the memory, is fetched into the control unit by supplying the memory with the address of the instruction. The control unit decodes the instruction in order to find the sequence of operation necessary to execute it.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The CPU executes a program that is stored as a sequence of machine language instructions in main memory. It does this by repeatedly reading, or fetching, an instruction from memory and then carrying out, or executing, that instruction.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-When the CPU executes a program, that program is stored in the computerâ€™s main memory (also called the RAM or random access memory). In addition to the program, memory can also hold data that is being used or processed by the program.
