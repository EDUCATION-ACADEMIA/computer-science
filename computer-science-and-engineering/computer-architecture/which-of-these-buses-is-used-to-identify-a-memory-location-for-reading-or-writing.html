<strong> Which of these buses is used to identify a memory location for reading or writing? 
</strong>
<p>(A) The system bus 
</p>
<p>(B) The data bus 
</p>
<p>(C) The control bus 
</p>
<p>(D) ** The address bus 
</p>
<p>

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The control bus is a signal line that specifies whether to read or write to the location specified by the address bus.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-An address bus is a bus that is used to specify a physical address. When a processor or DMA-enabled device needs to read or write to a memory location, it specifies that memory location on the address bus (the value to be read or written is sent on the data bus).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Explanation: Address bus is used to choose a particular location in the memory chip.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The control bus carries various synchronisation and control signals, the only one of interest to us being the read/write signal.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Address bus It is concerned with passing an address one way, from the CPU to RAM. The sole purpose of an address bus is to identify the address of the location in cache or main memory that is to be read from or written to. Each location in memory will have its own unique address, this is known as addressability.
