<meta name="description" content="A thread is a unit of execution on concurrent programming. Multithreading is a technique which allows a CPU to execute many tasks of one process at the same time. These threads can execute individually while sharing their resources.Multitasking is the mechanism by which the CPU of a computer is able to handle multiple tasks at the same time. During multitasking, the common resources like CPU and memory are shared, and this can cause a delay in the time it takes for data to travel from one point to another, or latency.True Multitasking Similar to humans brain, a CPU core can only handle one process at a time. It switches between different processes quickly (in milliseconds), making an illusion of true multitasking. This is called time-sharing, allocating computer resources to multiple processes.In a multithreaded process on a single processor, the processor can switch execution resources between threads, resulting in concurrent execution. Concurrency indicates that more than one thread is making progress, but the threads are not actually running simultaneously.The Motherboard Your computers brain is the CPU: thats where all of the programming and computing happens. But its nervous system is the motherboard, which uses circuits to connect the CPU to the other pieces of hardware, including the memory, the hard drive, the CD/DVD drive, and all of your peripherals.">

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-A thread is a unit of execution on concurrent programming. Multithreading is a technique which allows a CPU to execute many tasks of one process at the same time. These threads can execute individually while sharing their resources.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Multitasking is the mechanism by which the CPU of a computer is able to handle multiple tasks at the same time. During multitasking, the common resources like CPU and memory are shared, and this can cause a delay in the time it takes for data to travel from one point to another, or latency.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-True Multitasking Similar to human’s brain, a CPU core can only handle one process at a time. It switches between different processes quickly (in milliseconds), making an illusion of true multitasking. This is called time-sharing, allocating computer resources to multiple processes.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-In a multithreaded process on a single processor, the processor can switch execution resources between threads, resulting in concurrent execution. Concurrency indicates that more than one thread is making progress, but the threads are not actually running simultaneously.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The Motherboard Your computer’s brain is the CPU: that’s where all of the programming and computing happens. But its nervous system is the motherboard, which uses circuits to connect the CPU to the other pieces of hardware, including the memory, the hard drive, the CD/DVD drive, and all of your peripherals.
