<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Generally, the faster the RAM, the faster the processing speed. With faster RAM, you increase the speed at which memory transfers information to other components. Meaning, your fast processor now has an equally fast way of talking to the other components, making your computer much more efficient.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-RAM and CPU Performance RAM not only allows your CPU to access files faster, it can also help your processor run more processes at the same time. The more RAM you have, and the faster the RAM cycles in MHz, the more processes your CPU can run.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The speed and capacity of your PC’s system memory or RAM can significantly affect your computer’s startup speed. Nevertheless, adding more RAM will only be helpful up to a certain point. Adding too much RAM will eventually jeopardize the computer’s performance, even when you have enough of it.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-With more RAM, more of the program instructions can be loaded and there is less need to keep swapping data in and out to the swap file on the hard disk drive. The constant swapping of data slows down the speed at which applications can run, so increasing RAM will increase the speed of operation of the computer.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-More RAM Means Better Speed Adding more RAM to your computer is bound to speed it up more than any other upgrade you might make. This is because the most popular apps that run on Microsoft Windows are resource hogs. Running two or more applications simultaneously makes them compete for the digital workspace.
