<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Volatile memory is a type of memory that maintains its data only while the device is powered. If the power is interrupted for any reason, the data is lost.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Volatile memory, in contrast to non-volatile memory, is computer memory that requires power to maintain the stored information; it retains its contents while powered on but when the power is interrupted, the stored data is quickly lost.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-In general, volatile memory needs power to maintain the stored information. In contrast, the stored information is retained in nonvolatile memory when the power supply is turned off.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-It is the memory hardware that fetches/stores data at a high-speed. It is also referred as temporary memory. The data within the volatile memory is stored till the system is capable of, but once the system is turned off the data within the volatile memory is deleted automatically.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Volatile Memory is a type of memory hardware that stores and fetches data at a very high speed. We can also call it a temporary memory. The system stores its data within the volatile memory until its capacity. It then deletes this data automatically as soon as one shuts the system down.
