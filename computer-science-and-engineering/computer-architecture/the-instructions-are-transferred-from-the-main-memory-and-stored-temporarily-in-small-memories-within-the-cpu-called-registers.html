<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The instructions are transferred from the main memory and stored temporarily in small memories within the CPU called registers. The control unit interprets the instruction stored in the instruction register, turning it into a signal that can be understood by the ALU .
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Push and Pop − The push and pop instructions transfer data between a processor register and memory stack.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Temporary memory:-RAM is both used for temporary storage and from a technical perspective, it is only capable of temporary storage. The hard drive is capable of storing information after the computer turns off, but RAM is not. Once your computer turns off, any data that was in your RAM sticks is lost.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-RAM is used for immediate data storage and retrieval. Your RAM can process information significantly faster than data on a hard disk-twenty to a hundred times faster, depending on the specific hardware and task.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Cache memory. This temporary storage area, known as a cache, is more readily available to the processor than the computer’s main memory source. It is also called CPU memory because it is typically integrated directly into the CPU chip or placed on a separate chip with a bus interconnect with the CPU.
