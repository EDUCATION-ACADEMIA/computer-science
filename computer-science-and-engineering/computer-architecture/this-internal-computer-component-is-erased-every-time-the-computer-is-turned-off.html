<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Random Access Memory is volatile. That means data is retained in RAM as long as the computer is on, but it is lost when the computer is turned off. When the computer is rebooted, the OS and other files are reloaded into RAM, usually from an HDD or SSD.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-RAM is volatile memory, which means that the data stored in it is lost when the power is turned off. RAM is typically used to store the operating system, application programs, and data that the computer is currently using.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-RAM (random access memory) is a computer’s short-term memory, where the data that the processor is currently using is stored. Your computer can access RAM memory much faster than data on a hard disk, SSD, or other long-term storage device, which is why RAM capacity is critical for system performance.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-RAM is volatile memory, which means that the information temporarily stored in the module is erased when you restart or shut down your computer. Because the information is stored electrically on transistors, when there is no electric current, the data disappears.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-RAM is short for random access memory. It’s called random access because the data can be quickly read and modified in any order. Compare this with older storage media like CD-RWs, where data is accessed in a fixed sequence that’s slower.
