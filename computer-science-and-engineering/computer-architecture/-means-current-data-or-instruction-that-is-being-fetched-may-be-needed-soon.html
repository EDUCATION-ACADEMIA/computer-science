<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Temporal locality means current data or instruction that is being fetched may be needed soon. So we should store that data or instruction in the cache memory so that we can avoid again searching in main memory for the same data.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Temporal locality is the tendency of programs to use data items over and again during the course of their execution. This is the founding principle behind caches and gives a clear guide to an appropriate data-management heuristic.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Temporal Locality means that a instruction which is recently executed have high chances of execution again. So the instruction is kept in cache memory such that it can be fetched easily and takes no time in searching for the same instruction.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>–The temporal aspect of the locality of reference means that the recently executed instruction wont be executed soon.-Explanation: The spatial aspect of locality of reference tells that the nearby instruction is more likely to be executed in future.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-There are two basic types of reference locality – temporal and spatial locality. Temporal locality refers to the reuse of specific data and/or resources within a relatively small time duration. Spatial locality (also termed data locality) refers to the use of data elements within relatively close storage locations.
