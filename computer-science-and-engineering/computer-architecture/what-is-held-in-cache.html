<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-It stores program instructions and data that are used repeatedly in the operation of programs or information that the CPU is likely to need next. The computer processor can access this information more quickly from the cache than from the main memory.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Caches are used to store temporary files, using hardware and software components. An example of a hardware cache is a CPU cache. This is a small chunk of memory on the computer’s processor used to store basic computer instructions that were recently used or are frequently used.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-At the highest level, the most frequently used information-say, the instructions in a loop which execute repeatedly-is stored directly on a special section of the processor chip, called Level 1 (L1) cache. This is the fastest memory of all.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The basic purpose of cache memory is to store program instructions that are frequently re-referenced by software during operation. Fast access to these instructions increases the overall speed of the software program.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Data can be transferred to and from cache memory more quickly than from RAM. As a result, cache memory is used to temporarily hold data and instructions that the processor is likely to reuse. This allows for faster processing as the processor does not have to wait for the data and instructions to be fetched from RAM.
