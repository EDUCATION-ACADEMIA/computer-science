<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The control bus is bidirectional and assists the CPU in synchronizing control signals to internal devices and external components. It is comprised of interrupt lines, byte enable lines, read/write signals and status lines.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Control bus-carries control signals from the processor to other components. The control bus also carries the clockâ€™s pulses. The control bus is unidirectional.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Computer architecture Signals on the control bus tell the CPU whether a read or write operation to that memory cell is required. The address bus is unidirectional in that data is placed on it only by the CPU.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Alternatively known as an address bus, data bus, control bus, or local bus, a bus is a link between components or devices connected to a computer. For example, a bus carries data between a CPU and the system memory via the motherboard.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-While the address bus carries the information about the device with which the CPU is communicating and the data bus carries the actual data being processed, the control bus carries commands from the CPU and returns status signals from the devices.
