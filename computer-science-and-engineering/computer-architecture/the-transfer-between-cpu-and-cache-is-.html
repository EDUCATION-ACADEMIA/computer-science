<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The transfer between CPU and Cache is word transfer. The word that is transmitted in the medium of the memory data bus is between the CPU and the cache is known as word transfer. It is normally of the length of a single word or a half-word.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The basic operation of a cache memory is as follows: If the word is found in the cache, it is read from the fast memory. If the word addressed by the CPU is not found in the cache, the main memory is accessed to read the word. A block of words one just accessed is then transferred from main memory to cache memory.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-memory, called cache, is used between CPU and main memory to improve performance by reducing the data access time as shown is Figure 2 (b). Data between CPU and cache is transferred as data object and between cache and main memory as block as shown in Figure 2 (c).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The transfer between CPU and Cache is Best explanation: The transfer is a word transfer. In the memory subsystem, word is transferred over the memory data bus and it typically has a width of a word or half-word.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Cache entries Data is transferred between memory and cache in blocks of fixed size, called cache lines or cache blocks.
