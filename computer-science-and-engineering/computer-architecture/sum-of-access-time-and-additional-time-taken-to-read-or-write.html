<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Access time is sometimes used as a synonym (although IBM deprecates it). Cycle time is the time, usually measured in nanosecond s, between the start of one random access memory ( RAM ) access to the time when the next access can be started. Access time is sometimes used as a synonym (although IBM deprecates it).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Memory cycle time = access time plus transient time (any additional time required before a second access can commence).-Time may be required for the memory to “recover” before next access-Cycle time is access + recovery • Transfer Rate: This is the rate at which data can be transferred in and out of a memory unit.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Access Time is the amount of time it takes for the processor to read from memory (i.e.) it is the total time required by the computer to request for data and then the time needed for that request to be met. Lower Access Time of the computer is preferred as lower the access time faster the computer should perform.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-What is the general relationship among access time, memory cost, and capacity? As access time becomes faster, the cost per bit increases. As memory size increases, the cost per bit is smaller. Also, with greater capacity, the access time becomes slower.
