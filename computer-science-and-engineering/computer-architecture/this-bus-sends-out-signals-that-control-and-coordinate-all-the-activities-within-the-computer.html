<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-So control bus is a collection of signals that control how the processor communicates with rest of the system. Control bus carries the signals relating to the control and co-ordination of the various activities across the computer which can be sent from the control unit within the CPU.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The control bus contains a control line for write instructions and a control line for read instructions. When the CPU writes data to the main memory, it transmits a signal to the write command line. The CPU also sends a signal to the read command line when it needs to read.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Term: Control Bus The control bus carries signals that control and coordinate all the activities within the computer.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The control bus holds the control and timing signals needed to coordinate all of the computer’s activities.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Alternatively known as an address bus, data bus, control bus, or local bus, a bus is a link between components or devices connected to a computer. For example, a bus carries data between a CPU and the system memory via the motherboard.
