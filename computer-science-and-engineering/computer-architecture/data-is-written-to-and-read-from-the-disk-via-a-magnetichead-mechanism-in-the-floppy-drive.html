<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The mechanical arm is used to read from and write to the disk. The data on a magnetic disk is read and written using a magnetization process. The platter keeps spinning at high speed while the head of the arm moves across its surface. Since the whole device is hermetically sealed, the head floats on a thin film of air.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The information retrieved and written onto a floppy disk is controlled by the process of magnetic encoding. As the read/write head passes over designated tracks of the floppy disk it uses magnetic polarization to write information onto the disk, and to retrieve this information.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The mechanism for reading or writing data on a disk is an access arm; it moves a read/write head into position over a particular track. The read/write head on the end of the access arm hovers just above the track but does not actually touch the surface.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Expert-Verified Answer In a magnetic disk drive, a special device called the read/write head reads data from and writes data to a disk’s surface.
