<meta name="description" content="Correct choice is (a) Statement: We can use the finite control of turing machine to hold a finite amount of data. Explanation: The finite control not only contains state q but also three data, A, B, C. The following technique requires no extension to the Turing Machine model.We formalize Turings description as follows: A Turing machine consists of a finite program, called the finite control, capable of manipulating a linear list of cells, called the tape, using one access pointer, called the head. We refer to the two directions on the tape as right and left.The definition of Turing machines requires that the finite-state control unit have a finite number of states. Its not allowed to have an infinite number of states. A machine that could have infinitely many states in its control could accept any language (unlike a Turing machine).Detailed Solution. Explanation: Option 1: It may halt and accept the input. This is not correct since Given a Turing machine over an input can halt and accept the input.A turing machine has finite number of states in its CPU. However the states are not small in number.

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Correct choice is (a) Statement: We can use the finite control of turing machine to hold a finite amount of data. Explanation: The finite control not only contains state q but also three data, A, B, C. The following technique requires no extension to the Turing Machine model.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-We formalize Turing’s description as follows: A Turing machine consists of a finite program, called the finite control, capable of manipulating a linear list of cells, called the tape, using one access pointer, called the head. We refer to the two directions on the tape as ‘right’ and ‘left.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The definition of Turing machines requires that the finite-state control unit have a finite number of states. It’s not allowed to have an infinite number of states. A machine that could have infinitely many states in its control could accept any language (unlike a Turing machine).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Detailed Solution. Explanation: Option 1: It may halt and accept the input. This is not correct since Given a Turing machine over an input can halt and accept the input.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-A turing machine has finite number of states in its CPU. However the states are not small in number. Real computer consist of registers which can store values (fixed number of bits). 1 Crore+ students have signed up on EduRev.
