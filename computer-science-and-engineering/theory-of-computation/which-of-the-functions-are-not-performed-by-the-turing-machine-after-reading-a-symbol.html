<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-3. Which of the functions are not performed by the turing machine after reading a symbol? c) proceeds with subsequent instruction or goes either into accepting halting state or rejecting halting state. Explanation: The turing machine was invented by Alan turing in 1936.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Which of the functions can a turing machine not perform? a) Copying a string b) Deleting a symbol c) Accepting a pal d) Inserting a symbol Answer: d Explanation: Different turing machines exist for operations like copying a string, deleting a symbol, inserting a symbol and accepting palindromes.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Turing machines, first described by Alan Turing in Turing 1936–7, are simple abstract computational devices intended to help investigate the extent and limitations of what can be computed. Turing’s ‘automatic machines’, as he termed them in 1936, were specifically devised for the computing of real numbers.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-3. Which of the following a turing machine does not consist of? Explanation: A state register is one which stores the state of the turing machine, one of the finitely many. Among these is the special start state with which the state register is initialized.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Detailed Solution. Explanation: Option 1: It may halt and accept the input. This is not correct since Given a Turing machine over an input can halt and accept the input.
