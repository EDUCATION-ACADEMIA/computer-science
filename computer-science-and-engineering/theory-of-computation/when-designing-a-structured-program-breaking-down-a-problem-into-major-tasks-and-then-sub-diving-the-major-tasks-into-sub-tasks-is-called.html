<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The bottom-up approach works by starting with individual components and building up to the larger system. This approach is characterized by: Breaking down a large problem or project into smaller, more manageable tasks.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-A top-down design is the decomposition of a system into smaller parts in order to comprehend its compositional sub-systems. In top-down design, a systemâ€™s overview is designed, specifying, yet not detailing any first-level subsystems.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-A top-down approach (also known as stepwise design and stepwise refinement and in some cases used as a synonym of decomposition) is essentially the breaking down of a system to gain insight into its compositional sub-systems in a reverse engineering fashion.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Summary. The top-down approach to management is when company-wide decisions are made solely by leadership at the top, while the bottom-up approach gives all teams a voice in these types of decisions. Below, we cover the details, pros, and cons of top-down vs. bottom-up management.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Top down analysis is a problem solving mechanism whereby a given problem is successively broken down into smaller and smaller sub-problems or operations until a set of easily solvable (by computer) sub-problems is arrived at.
