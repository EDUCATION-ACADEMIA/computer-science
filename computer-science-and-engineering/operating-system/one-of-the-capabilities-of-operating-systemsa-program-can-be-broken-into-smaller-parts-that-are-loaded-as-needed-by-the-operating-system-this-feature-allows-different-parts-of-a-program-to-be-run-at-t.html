<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Multiprocessing allows an operating system to use two or more CPUs. Support for two or more users is provided by the multiuser feature. Multitasking allows multiple applications to run at the same time.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-A program can be broken into smaller parts that are loaded as needed by the operating system. Multithreading allows different parts of a program to be run at the same time. Two or more users have individual accounts allow them to work with programs and peripheral devices at the same time.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Multitasking, in an operating system, is allowing a user to perform more than one computer task (such as the operation of an application program) at a time. The operating system is able to keep track of where you are in these tasks and go from one to the other without losing information.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Multithreading : Allows different parts of a single program to run concurrently.
