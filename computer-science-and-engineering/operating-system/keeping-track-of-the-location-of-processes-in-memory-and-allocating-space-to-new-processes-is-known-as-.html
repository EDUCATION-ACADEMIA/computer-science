<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Memory management is the functionality of an operating system which handles or manages primary memory and moves processes back and forth between main memory and disk during execution. Memory management keeps track of each and every memory location, regardless of either it is allocated to some process or it is free.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The correct answer is Memory Management. Memory Management performs the task of allocation and deallocation of memory space to program.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Memory management is the process of allocating memory to programs and keeping the programs in memory separate from one another. Some systems divide memory into separate areas, called partitions or regions.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Memory management is the process of controlling and coordinating a computerâ€™s main memory. It ensures that blocks of memory space are properly managed and allocated so the operating system (OS), applications and other running processes have the memory they need to carry out their operations.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The memory management in the operating system is to control or maintain the main memory and transfer processes from the primary memory to disk during execution. Memory management keeps track of all memory locations, whether the process uses them or not. Determines how much memory should be allocated to each process.
