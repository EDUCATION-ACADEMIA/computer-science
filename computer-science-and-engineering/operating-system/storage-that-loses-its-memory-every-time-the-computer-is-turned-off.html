If the power is interrupted for any reason, the data is lost.Random Access Memory is volatile. That means data is retained in RAM as long as the computer is on, but it is lost when the computer is turned off.

It loses integrity after loss of power. RAM memory modules are installed into slots on the computer motherboard. ROM (Read-Only Memory) is nonvolatile: data stored in ROM maintains integrity after loss of power.RAM is often referred to as volatile memory, because anything contained in RAM is considered lost when a computer is switched off.

This means it needs a constantly recycled charge to hold its data. If the power is turned off, it cannot refresh the data and it is lost. This is known as DYNAMIC memory.">

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Volatile memory is a type of memory that maintains its data only while the device is powered. If the power is interrupted for any reason, the data is lost.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Random Access Memory is volatile. That means data is retained in RAM as long as the computer is on, but it is lost when the computer is turned off. When the computer is rebooted, the OS and other files are reloaded into RAM, usually from an HDD or SSD.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-RAM is volatile memory used to hold instructions and data of currently running programs. It loses integrity after loss of power. RAM memory modules are installed into slots on the computer motherboard. ROM (Read-Only Memory) is nonvolatile: data stored in ROM maintains integrity after loss of power.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-RAM is often referred to as volatile memory, because anything contained in RAM is considered lost when a computer is switched off. Indeed, all data is lost from RAM when the power supply is disconnected; so it is volatile in this context.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-RAM is volatile memory, which stores data in a single transistor and capacitor. This means it needs a constantly recycled charge to hold its data. If the power is turned off, it cannot refresh the data and it is lost. This is known as DYNAMIC memory.
