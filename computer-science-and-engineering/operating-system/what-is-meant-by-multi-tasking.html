<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Multitasking involves overlapping and interleaving the execution of several programs. This is often achieved by capitalizing on the difference between a computer’s rapid processing capacity and the slower rates of its input/output devices.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Multitasking, in an operating system, is allowing a user to perform more than one computer task (such as the operation of an application program) at a time.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Multitasking, in a human context, is the practice of doing multiple things simultaneously, such as editing a document or responding to email while attending a teleconference. The concept of multitasking began in a computing context.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Multiuser/Multitasking OS It is an operating system that permits several users to utilize the programs that are concurrently running on a single network server. The single network server is termed as “Terminal server". “Terminal client” is a software that supports user sessions. Examples include UNIX, MVS, etc.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-multiprocessing, in computing, a mode of operation in which two or more processors in a computer simultaneously process two or more different portions of the same program (set of instructions).
