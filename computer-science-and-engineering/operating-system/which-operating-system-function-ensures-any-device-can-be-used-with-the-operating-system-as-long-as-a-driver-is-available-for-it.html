<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Each connected device has its own driver. any device can be used with the operating system, as long as a driver is available for it.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Peripheral Device Management protects your business through effective device management and lockdown of unauthorized devices, such as USB drives, cell phones, portable hard drives, and music players: Block use of prohibited external devices. Understand and manage all removable devices on your network.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The device driver provides the rest of the operating system with the software interface to a given device or device class. The upper layer recognizes which commands are required to control a particular device or device class.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-UI. Every operating system requires a UI, enabling users and administrators to interact with the OS in order to set up, configure and even troubleshoot the operating system and its underlying hardware. There are two primary types of UI available: CLI and GUI.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-A device driver is a software method that is mainly utilized in computers to execute and operate systems that interact with a component of a device. On the other hand, a device controller is a hardware method that is mainly utilized to connect a computerâ€™s OS and functions in the phase by connecting the device driver.
