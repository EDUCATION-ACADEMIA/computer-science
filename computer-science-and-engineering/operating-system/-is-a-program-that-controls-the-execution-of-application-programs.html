<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-An operating system (OS) is a program that controls the execu-tion of an application program and acts as an interface between the user of a computer and computer hardware. The purpose of an OS is to provide an environment in which a user can execute programs in a convenient and efficient manner. it does them.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-An operating system is a program that acts as an interface between the computer user and computer hardware, and controls the execution of programs.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Software in charge of other software or hardware. For example, the primary control program in a computer is the operating system (OS). It sets the standards that all applications must use to interface with the OS (see API and OS). All peripheral devices in a computer are controlled by software, also known as a driver.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Operating system (OS) – a software that controls and coordinates the computer hardware devices and runs other software and applications on a computer. It is the main part of system software and a computer will not function without it.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-When you double-click the program, the operating system “launches” the program, doing the housekeeping steps of allocating an area of memory within RAM for the program, loading the first section of the program’s machine code into that memory, and finally directing the CPU to start running that code.
