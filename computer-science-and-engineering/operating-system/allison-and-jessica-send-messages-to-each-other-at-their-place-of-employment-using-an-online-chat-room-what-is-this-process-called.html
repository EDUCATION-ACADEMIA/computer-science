<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Wide Area Network (WAN)-Similar to a MAN, a WAN can connect devices across a larger geographical area but is typically maintained by multiple administrators rather than a single entity. A WAN can also interconnect smaller LANs and are typically used across multiple branches of the same company.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Two basic network types are local-area networks (LANs) and wide-area networks (WANs). LANs connect computers and peripheral devices in a limited physical area, such as a business office, laboratory, or college campus, by means of links (wires, Ethernet cables, fibre optics, Wi-Fi) that transmit data rapidly.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Personal computer (PC) – a small computer designed for use by a single user at a time. A PC or microcomputer uses a single chip (microprocessor) for its central processing unit (CPU).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-A Firewall is a network security device that monitors and filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on an organization’s previously established security policies. At its most basic, a firewall is essentially the barrier that sits between a private internal network and the public Internet.
