<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Processor scheduling is the allocation of a computer’s processor power to specific tasks. The practice uses the term “scheduling” because it assigns a specific percentage of time the processor is running to individual tasks.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-CPU scheduling is a process of determining which process will own CPU for execution while another process is on hold. In Preemptive Scheduling, the tasks are mostly assigned with their priorities. In the Non-preemptive scheduling method, the CPU has been allocated to a specific process.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The short-term scheduler (also known as the CPU scheduler) decides which of the ready, in-memory processes is to be executed after a clock interrupt, an I/O interrupt, an operating system call or another form of signal.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Scheduling of processes/work is done to finish the work on time. CPU Scheduling is a process that allows one process to use the CPU while another process is delayed (in standby) due to unavailability of any resources such as I / O etc, thus making full use of the CPU.
