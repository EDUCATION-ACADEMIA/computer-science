<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-However, using virtual memory means the device will run slower than if it was using RAM. This is because the processor has to wait while the data is being swapped between the RAM and the hard disk. Secondary storage devices, such as a hard disk, have slower access times and can impair the device’s processing time.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Only core parts of the operating system kernel bypass this address translation and use real memory addresses directly. Virtual memory is always being used, even when the memory that is required by all running processes does not exceed the volume of RAM that is installed on the system.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-If your system has to rely too heavily on virtual memory, you will notice a significant performance drop. The key is to have enough RAM to handle everything you tend to work on simultaneously–then, the only time you “feel” the slowness of virtual memory is is when there’s a slight pause when you’re changing tasks.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-When virtual memory is increased, the empty space reserved for RAM overflow increases. Having enough available space is absolutely necessary for virtual memory and RAM to function properly.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-If virtual memory doesn’t exist, we can’t load more than one program in the main memory. This means that without virtual memory, we can only run one program at a time. This is because each program might have to use different functions that may point to the same addresses in RAM.
