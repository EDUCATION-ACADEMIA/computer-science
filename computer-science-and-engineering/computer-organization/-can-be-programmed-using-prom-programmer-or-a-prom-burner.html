<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-PROMs are manufactured blank and, depending on the technology, can be programmed at wafer, final test, or in system. Blank PROM chips are programmed by plugging them into a device called a PROM programmer.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Consumer electronics – PROMs are used in many consumer electronics devices such as digital cameras, DVD players, and personal computers. Medical devices – medical devices such as pacemakers and defibrillators often use PROMs to store their operating instructions.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-In summary, the PROM is less expensive than the EPROM, but it can only be programmed once, whereas the EPROM can be programmed several times, but the chip must be taken out of the system to remove the data.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The data can be erased and the chip reprogrammed by shining an intense ultraviolet (UV) light through a window designed into the memory chip. This process is known as burning and requires a specific device called a PROM programmer, which is plugged in to an EPROM burner.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The process of programming a PROM chip is called PROM “burning” or “blowing” because it involves burning or blowing out the fuses of some cells whose value needs to be altered from 1 to 0. Before programming a PROM chip, the PROM programmer is first configured so it contains the desired PROM burning instructions.
