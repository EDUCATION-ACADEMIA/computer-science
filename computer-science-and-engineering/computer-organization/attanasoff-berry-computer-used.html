<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-It contained approximately 1-mile (1.6 km) of wire, 280 dual-triode vacuum tubes, 31 thyratrons, and was about the size of a desk. It was not programmable, which distinguishes it from more general machines of the same era, such as Konrad Zuse’s 1941 Z3 (or earlier iterations) and the Colossus computers of 1943–1945.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The ABC featured about 300 vacuum tubes for control and arithmetic calculations, use of binary numbers, logic operations (instead of direct counting), memory capacitors, and punched cards as input/output units.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-John Vincent Atanasoff is known as the father of the computer. With the help of one of his students Clifford E. Berry, in Iowa State College, during the 1940s, he created the ABC (Atanasoff-Berry Computer) that was the first electronic digital computer.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-World’s first electronic digital computer Clifford Berry with Atanasoff-Berry Computer (Photo courtesy Iowa State University Library/Special Collections Department.) The Atanasoff-Berry Computer (ABC) was the world’s first electronic digital computer.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-First Computers ENIAC (Electrical Numerical Integrator and Calculator) used a word of 10 decimal digits instead of binary ones like previous automated calculators/computers. ENIAC was also the first machine to use more than 2, 000 vacuum tubes, using nearly 18, 000 vacuum tubes.
