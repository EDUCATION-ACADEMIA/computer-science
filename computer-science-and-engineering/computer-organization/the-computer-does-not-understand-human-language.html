<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Instead of merely looking at individual letters as symbols, through the ability of processing natural language, computers are able to take words and even phrases and actually make sense from them. They can take phrases to make sentences, and then use those sentences to create and convey ideas.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Many people within the tech industry are able to translate from human language to machine language, making them bilingual in both human and computer. The machines however, are just fluent in computer, and cannot truly understand human.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-But the computer cannot understand the language of the user, because it cannot read the mind of the user. It needs command to perform a particular task. Computer is a brilliant source for doing any task accurately but it can’t understand user’s language.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-A computer cannot understand any commands that you may give in English or in any other language. It has its own set of instructions for communication, or what we call computer languages. This is an important part of your syllabus for banking exams.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-About the art. One reason that understanding language is so difficult for computers and AI systems is that words often have meanings based on context and even the appearance of the letters and words.
