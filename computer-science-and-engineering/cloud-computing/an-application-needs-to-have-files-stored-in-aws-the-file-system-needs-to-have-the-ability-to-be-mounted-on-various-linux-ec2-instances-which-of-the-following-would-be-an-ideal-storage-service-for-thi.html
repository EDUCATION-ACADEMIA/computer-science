<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-With Amazon EFS, you can create a file system, mount the file system on an Amazon EC2 instance, and then read and write data to and from your file system. You can mount an Amazon EFS file system in your virtual private cloud (VPC), through the Network File System versions 4.0 and 4.1 (NFSv4) protocol.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Which EC2 Storage would you use to create a shared network file system for your EC2 Instances? Amazon EFS-Elastic File System is a fully managed service that makes it easy to set up, scale, and cost-optimise file storage in the Amazon Cloud.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-AWS Storage Gateway is a hybrid cloud storage service that gives you on-premises access to virtually unlimited cloud storage. Storage Gateway provides a standard set of storage protocols such as iSCSI, SMB, and NFS, which allow you to use AWS storage without rewriting your existing applications.
