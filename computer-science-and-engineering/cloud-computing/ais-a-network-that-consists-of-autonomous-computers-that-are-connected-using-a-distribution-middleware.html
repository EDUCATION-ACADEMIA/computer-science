<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-A distributed system is any network structure that consists of autonomous computers that are connected using a distribution middleware. Distributed systems facilitate sharing different resources and capabilities, to provide users with a single and integrated coherent network.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Middleware in the context of distributed applications is software that provides services beyond those provided by the operating system to enable the various components of a distributed system to communicate and manage data. Middleware supports and simplifies complex distributed applications.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-“A distributed system is a collection of autonomous computers that are interconnected with each other and cooperate, thereby sharing resources such as printers and databases” (Leopold 2).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-A distributed system is a computing environment in which various components are spread across multiple computers (or other computing devices) on a network. These devices split up the work, coordinating their efforts to complete the job more efficiently than if a single device had been responsible for the task.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-A system that can operate completely without an operator, is an autonomous system. The system is programmed to perform a specific task, considering all environment factors.
