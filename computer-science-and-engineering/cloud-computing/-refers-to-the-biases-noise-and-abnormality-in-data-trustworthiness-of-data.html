<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Veracity is the fourth V in the 5 Vâ€™s of big data. It refers to the quality and accuracy of data. Gathered data could have missing pieces, may be inaccurate or may not be able to provide real, valuable insight. Veracity, overall, refers to the level of trust there is in the collected data.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Veracity refers to the degree of accuracy in data sets and how trustworthy they are. Raw data collected from various sources can cause data quality issues that may be difficult to pinpoint.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The variety in data types frequently requires distinct processing capabilities and specialist algorithms. An example of high variety data sets would be the CCTV audio and video files that are generated at various locations in a city. Veracity refers to the quality of the data that is being analyzed.
