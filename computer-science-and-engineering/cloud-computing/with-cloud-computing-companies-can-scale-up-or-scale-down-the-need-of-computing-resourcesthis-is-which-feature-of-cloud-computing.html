<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Elasticity is the capability for a cloud-based program to require more or fewer resources, to put it simply. You can scale computer processing, memory, and storage capacity in cloud computing to match changing demands. Thanks to scalability, you won’t have to worry about peak engineering or capacity planning.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-There are two basic types of scalability in cloud computing: vertical and horizontal scaling. With vertical scaling, also known as “scaling up” or “scaling down, ” you add or subtract power to an existing cloud server upgrading memory (RAM), storage or processing power (CPU).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Regarding cloud computing, scalability and elasticity are two important concepts you need to understand. Scalability is the ability of a system or network to handle increased load or usage. At the same time, elasticity is the ability to automatically expand and contract resources to meet demand.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Cloud Elasticity enables organizations to rapidly scale capacity up or down, either automatically or manually. Cloud Elasticity can refer to ‘cloudbursting’ from on-premises infrastructure into the public cloud for example to meet a sudden or seasonal demand.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Autoscaling enables resources to scale up only when needed and scale down when traffic subsides. It is one way for businesses to reduce cloud costs. Automation. Organizations can manually add resources when needed, but that is not a scalable or efficient approach.
