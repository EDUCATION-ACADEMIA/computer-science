<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-It is based on a pay-per-use model (pay as you go model). It offers computational resources on demand as a metered service. Cloud computing, grid computing, and managed IT services are based on this concept.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Utility computing is a model in which computing resources are provided to the customer based on specific demand.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Pay-as-you-go cloud computing (PAYG cloud computing) is a payment method for cloud computing that charges based on usage. The practice is similar to that of utility bills, using only resources that are needed.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Utility computing is basically related to the business model in the application infrastructure resource. This could either be hardware or software which gets delivered. Cloud computing relates to the way it is designed, deployed, built, and runs applications that operate in a virtual environment.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The term managed services is also used to describe utility computing. It is an overall term for various third-party technology and support services.
