<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-8. An application that needed storage alone might not benefit from a cloud deployment at all. Explanation: You could safely conclude that an application that gets the most value from a cloud deployment is one that uses online storage without the need for offline storage.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-All applications benefit from deployment in the Cloud. Cloud computing is revolutionary, even though the technology it is built on is evolutionary.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Cloud file storage is a method for storing data in the cloud that provides servers and applications access to data through shared file systems. This compatibility makes cloud file storage ideal for workloads that rely on shared file systems and provides simple integration without code changes.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Private cloud (also known as an internal cloud or corporate cloud) is a cloud computing environment in which all hardware and software resources are dedicated exclusively to, and accessible only by, a single customer.
