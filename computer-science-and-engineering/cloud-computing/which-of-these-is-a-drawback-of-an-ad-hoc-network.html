<strong> Which of these is a drawback of an ad-hoc network? 
</strong>
<p>(A) More devices can be added at any time 
</p>
<p>(B) They are flexible in how they can be set up 
</p>
<p>(C) They aren’t useful at all 
</p>
<p>(D) ** There is no one single device that has overall control, which means it can become unorgainsed

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The biggest drawback to using ad-hoc mode is the lack of security, which is why most new wireless devices do not support the use of ad-hoc networks.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Ad hoc networks often suffer from poor wireless communication range issues, because antennas built into endpoints were not designed to be as powerful as purpose-built WAPs. Ad hoc networks also do not scale well.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The primary danger in the use of AD HOC wireless networks is that: The user running the Ad hoc network will suffer performance issues. Critical organizational data obtained via the secured network may be on the user’s end node computer drive and thus exposed to discovery via the unsecured Ad hoc network.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Each node in the network forwards the packet without the need of central administration. In ad hoc network, node acts as a router to send and receive the data. An advantage of the system is robustness, flexibility and mobility.
