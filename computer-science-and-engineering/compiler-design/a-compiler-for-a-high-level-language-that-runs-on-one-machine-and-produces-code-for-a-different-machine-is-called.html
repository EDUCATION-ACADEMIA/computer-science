<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-What is the compiler called which runs on one machine and produces code for a different machine? Explanation: The compiler called which runs on one machine and produces code for the different machines is called a cross compiler.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-A cross compiler is a compiler capable of creating executable code for a platform other than the one on which the compiler is running. For example, a compiler that runs on a PC but generates code that runs on an Android smartphone is a cross compiler.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Compiler. A compiler is a computer program that translates a program written in a high-level language to the machine language of a computer. The high-level program is referred to as ‘the source code. ‘ A typical computer program processes some type of input data to produce output data.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-A compiler which runs on one machine and and produces the target code for another machine. Such compiler is called a cross-compiler.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-A cross compiler is a compiler that may run on one machine and produce output target code for another machine. This process of generating a compiler for a new machine is called a cross compiler.
