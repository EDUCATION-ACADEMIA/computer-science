<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-If there are more than 1 topological sorting of a DAG is possible, which of the following is true. Explanation: For a Hamiltonian path to exist all the vertices must be connected with a path, had that happened there would have been a unique topological sort.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Conversely, if a topological sort does not form a Hamiltonian path, the DAG will have two or more valid topological orderings, for in this case it is always possible to form a second valid ordering by swapping two consecutive vertices that are not connected by an edge to each other.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Number of different topological orderings possible = 6.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-There can be multiple topological ordering for a Directed Acyclic Graph. In order to have a topological sorting, the graph must not contain any cycles and it must be directed i.e. the graph must be a DAG.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-A topological sort of a DAG G = ( V, E ) is a linear ordering of v V such that if ( u, v ) E then u appears before v in this ordering. If G is cyclic, no such ordering exists: Topological sort can also be viewed as placing all the vertices along a horizontal line so that all directed edges go from left to right.
