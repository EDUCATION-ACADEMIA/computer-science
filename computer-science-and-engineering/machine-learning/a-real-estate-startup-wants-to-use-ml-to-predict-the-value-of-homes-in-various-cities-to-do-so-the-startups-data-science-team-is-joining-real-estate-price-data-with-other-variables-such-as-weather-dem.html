<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Step 2: Data Cleaning Next, this data flows to the cleaning step. To make sure the data paints a consistent picture that your pipeline can learn from, Cortex automatically detects and scrubs away outliers, missing values, duplicates, and other errors.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-What Amazon SageMaker option should the company use to train their ML models that reduces the management and automates the pipeline for future retraining? Create and train your XGBoost algorithm on your local laptop and then use an Amazon SageMaker endpoint to host the ML model.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-To give inputs to a machine learning model, you have to create a NumPy array, where you have to input the values of the features you used to train your machine learning model. Then we can use that array in the model. predict() method, and at the end, it will give the predicted value as an output based on the inputs.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Answer: (4) Classification Classification is a machine learning approach that helps address the question and the category to which the data belongs.
