With Sensors, it senses the surrounding, and with Actuators, it acts on it. Answer: d.Explanation: An AI agent perceives and acts upon the environment using Sensors and Actuators.♦ An agent is anything that can be viewed as perceiving its environment through sensors and acting upon that environment through actuators.Anyway, in the context of the AI field, an agent is an independent program or entity that interacts with its environment by perceiving its surroundings via sensors, then acting through actuators or effectors. Agents use their actuators to run through a cycle of perception, thought, and action.Correct answer: 2 The main task of an AI-based agent is to perceive the relevant information and data from its environment and act upon it accordingly.">
