<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Question: Suppose your email program watches which emails you do or do not mark as spam, and based on that learns how to better filter spam. What is the task T in this setting? Classifying emails as spam or not spam.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Naïve Bayes example code The below example code is to predict whether the person has diabetes or not. In order to predict that we have made use of Gaussian Naïve Bayes algorithm and also to detect the accuracy of our model.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Clustering and Association are two types of Unsupervised learning.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Unsupervised learning allows us to approach problems with little or no idea what our results should look like. We can derive structure from data where we don’t necessarily know the effect of the variables. We can derive this structure by clustering the data based on relationships among the variables in the data.
