<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-“By 2029, computers will have human-level intelligence, ” Kurzweil said in an interview with SXSW. The singularity is that point in time when all the advances in technology, particularly in artificial intelligence (AI), will lead to machines that are smarter than human beings.
</p>

<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-“I have also set the date 2045 for singularity-which is when humans will multiply our effective intelligence a billion fold, by merging with the intelligence we have created.” “By 2029, computers will have human-level intelligence, ” Kurzweil said.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-According to Kurzweil, 2045 will ring in the singularity. Computing power will be so great that it will be impossible for ordinary humans (not augmented by technology) to keep up, and augmentation will be so common that the line between human and machine will be blurred.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Kurzweil famously predicted that the technological singularity-the crucial moment when machines become smarter than humans-will occur in our lifetime. Though this may seem incredible, he has made many outrageous predictions over the years with an astounding 86 percent success rate, according to Futurism.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The Futurist Kurzweil continues to share his visions for the future, and his latest prediction was made at the most recent SXSW Conference, where he claimed that the Singularity-the moment when technology becomes smarter than humans-will happen by 2045. Sixteen years prior to that, it will be just as smart as us.
