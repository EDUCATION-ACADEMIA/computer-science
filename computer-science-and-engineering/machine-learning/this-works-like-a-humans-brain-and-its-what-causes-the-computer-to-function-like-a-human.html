<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-An artificial neural network is an attempt to simulate the network of neurons that make up a human brain so that the computer will be able to learn things and make decisions in a humanlike manner. ANNs are created by programming regular computers to behave as though they are interconnected brain cells.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Processor: This is probably the simplest parallel to grasp. It refers to the central processing circuitry that carries out instructions provided. In a computer, this is managed by its CPU, whereas for humans it is the Central Nervous System comprised of the brain and spinal cord and their internal circuitry.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The human brain consists of neurons or nerve cells which transmit and process the information received from our senses. Many such nerve cells are arranged together in our brain to form a network of nerves. These nerves pass electrical impulses i.e the excitation from one neuron to the other.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-For one, human brains are far more complex and sophisticated than neural networks. Additionally, human brains are able to learn and adapt much more quickly than neural networks. Finally, human brains are able to generate new ideas and concepts, while neural networks are limited to the data they are given.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The brain is a biological organ, and not a digital computer. Neuroscience has discovered that while the brain mediates between the body and the environment, it does not command the body. Often brain problems can be traced to problems in the rest of the body, and not to a malfunctioning brain.
