<strong> How does deep learning differ from conventional machine learning? 
</strong>
<p>(A) ** Deep learning algorithms can handle more data and run with less supervision from data scientists. 
</p>
<p>(B) Machine learning is simpler, and thus requires less oversight by data analysts than deep learning does. 
</p>
<p>(C) There are no real differences between the two ____ they are the same tool with different names.

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Machine learning and deep learning are both types of AI. In short, machine learning is AI that can automatically adapt with minimal human interference. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks to mimic the learning process of the human brain.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Machine learning is about computers being able to think and act with less human intervention; deep learning is about computers learning to think using structures modeled on the human brain. Machine learning requires less computing power; deep learning typically needs less ongoing human intervention.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with at least three layers. Compared to a network with just one layer, a network with multiple layers can deliver more accurate results. Both RNNs and CNNs are used in deep learning, depending on the application.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-A traditional algorithm takes some input and some logic in the form of code and drums up the output. As opposed to this, a Machine Learning Algorithm takes an input and an output and gives the some logic which can then be used to work with new input to give one an output. The logic generated is what makes it ML.
