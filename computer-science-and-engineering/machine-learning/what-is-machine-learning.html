<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Machine learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows software applications to become more accurate at predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms use historical data as input to predict new output values.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Explanation : * Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that can improve automatically through experience and by the use of data. It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence. * Machine learning is the autonomous acquisition of knowledge through the use of computer programs.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Machine learning is the Science of Getting computers to learn without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning works on a simple concept that is understanding with experiences. The primary aim of machine learning is to allow computers to learn automatically without human interaction.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-At the center of autonomous systems, machine learning is when an application can learn and improve from data and experience, without being programmed to do so and with minimal to no human contact. This technology is fundamental to be able to predict, plan and sense the environment.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy.
