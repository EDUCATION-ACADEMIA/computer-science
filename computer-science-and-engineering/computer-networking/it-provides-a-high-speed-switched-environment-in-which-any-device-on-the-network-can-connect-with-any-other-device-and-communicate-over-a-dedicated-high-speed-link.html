<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-A SAN (storage area network) is a tightly coupled, dedicated network of storage devices that provides a shared pool of storage and appears to each user on the network as if it were connected directly to the computer. A SAN connects via Fibre Channel and uses switches to manage storage data traffic.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-NAS. Both SAN and network-attached storage (NAS) are methods of managing storage centrally and sharing that storage with multiple hosts (servers). However, NAS is Ethernet-based, while SAN can use Ethernet and Fibre Channel.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-LAN is a group of computers and peripheral devices that share a common communications line or wireless link to a server within a distinct geographic area. SAN is a dedicated high-speed network or subnetwork that interconnects and presents shared pools of storage devices to multiple servers.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-A SAN (storage area network) is a network of storage devices that can be accessed by multiple servers or computers, providing a shared pool of storage space. Each computer on the network can access storage on the SAN as though they were local disks connected directly to the computer.
