<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-A local area network (LAN) is a collection of devices connected together in one physical location, such as a building, office, or home. A LAN can be small or large, ranging from a home network with one user to an enterprise network with thousands of users and devices in an office or school.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-A local area network (LAN) is a group of computers and peripheral devices that share a common communications line or wireless link to a server within a distinct geographic area.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-A local area network (LAN) consists of a series of computers linked together to form a network in a circumscribed location. The computers in a LAN connect to each other via TCP/IP ethernet or Wi-Fi.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The most frequently used shared network environment objects are files, data, multimedia and hardware resources like printers, fax machines and scanners.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-A router is a network communication device that is used to connect two or more logically and physically different networks. A router can be used to connect a LAN to LAN, LAN to WAN and LAN to internet. A router acts as a post office where sorting and distribution of the posts (packets in case of routers) is done.
