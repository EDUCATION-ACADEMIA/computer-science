<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Latency is the delay that occurs between a user’s action on a web application or network and the response they receive. Another latency definition is the total round trip time required for a packet of data to travel.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Network latency is the delay in network communication. It shows the time that data takes to transfer across the network. Networks with a longer delay or lag have high latency, while those with fast response times have low latency.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Many other types of latency exist, such as RAM latency (a.k.a. “CAS latency"), CPU latency, audio latency, and video latency. The common thread between all of these is some type of bottleneck that results in a delay.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-How to Measure Network Latency. Once you type in the tracert command, you’ll see a list of all routers on the path to that website address, followed by a time measurement in milliseconds (ms). Add up all the measurements, and the resulting quantity is the latency between your machine and the website in question.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Latent effects are those in which exposure is followed by some period of time before a specific response is developed. The majority of xenobiotics exhibits some degree of latency, as most tissues are also not immediately accessible from the site of adsorption and require one of more distribution events.
