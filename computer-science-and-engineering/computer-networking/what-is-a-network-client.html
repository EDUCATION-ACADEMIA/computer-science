<meta name="description" content="Client-server networks are computer networks that use a dedicated computer (server) to store data, manage/provide resources and control user access. The server acts as a central point on the network upon which the other computers connect to. A computer that connects to the server is called a client.A client-server network is a communications architecture in which clients receive resources and services from a dedicated host over a local area network (LAN) or a wide-area network (WAN), such as the Internet.A client-server network is designed for end-users, called clients, to access resources such as files, songs, video collections, or some other service from a central computer called a server. A servers sole purpose is to do what its name implies-serve its clients!Network sockets A socket represents one end of the connection between client and server. A listening socket is used by a server process to wait for connections from remote clients. In Java, use ServerSocket to make a listening socket, and use its accept method to listen to it.Used in home and corporate networks, a client is any computer hardware or software device that requests access to a service provided by a server. Clients are typically seen as the requesting program or user in a client-server architecture.">

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Client-server networks are computer networks that use a dedicated computer (server) to store data, manage/provide resources and control user access. The server acts as a central point on the network upon which the other computers connect to. A computer that connects to the server is called a client.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-A client-server network is a communications architecture in which clients receive resources and services from a dedicated host over a local area network (LAN) or a wide-area network (WAN), such as the Internet.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-A client-server network is designed for end-users, called clients, to access resources such as files, songs, video collections, or some other service from a central computer called a server. A serverâ€™s sole purpose is to do what its name implies-serve its clients!
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Network sockets A socket represents one end of the connection between client and server. A listening socket is used by a server process to wait for connections from remote clients. In Java, use ServerSocket to make a listening socket, and use its accept method to listen to it.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Used in home and corporate networks, a client is any computer hardware or software device that requests access to a service provided by a server. Clients are typically seen as the requesting program or user in a client-server architecture.
