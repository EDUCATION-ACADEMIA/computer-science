<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-WAN A wide area network (WAN) is a network that covers a large geographic area (such as a city, country, or the world) using a communications channel that combines many types of media such as telephone lines, cables, and radio waves (Figure 8-8).
</p>

<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-LAN is a network that usually connects a small group of computers in a given geographical area. MAN is a comparatively wider network that covers large regions-like towns, cities, etc. The WAN network spans to an even larger locality. It has the capacity to connect various countries together.
