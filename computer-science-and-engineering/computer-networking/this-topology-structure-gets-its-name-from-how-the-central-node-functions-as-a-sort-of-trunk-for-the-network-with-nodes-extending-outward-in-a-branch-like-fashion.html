<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The tree topology structure gets its name from how the central node functions as a sort of trunk for the network, with nodes extending outward in a branch-like fashion.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Bus topology, also known as line topology, is a type of network topology in which all devices in the network are connected by one central RJ-45 network cable or coaxial cable. The single cable, where all data is transmitted between devices, is referred to as the bus, backbone, or trunk.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Detailed Solution. The correct answer is Star Topology. It is an arrangement of the network in which every node is connected to the central hub, switch, or a central computer. The central computer is known as a server, and the peripheral devices attached to the server are known as clients.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Star Topology Star Topology Diagram. In the star topology, all the computers connect with the help of a hub. This cable is called a central node, and all other nodes are connected using this central node. It is most popular on LAN networks as they are inexpensive and easy to install.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Star topology is a network topology where each individual piece of a network is attached to a central node (often called a hub or switch). The attachment of these network pieces to the central component is visually represented in a form similar to a star. Star topology is also known as a star network.
