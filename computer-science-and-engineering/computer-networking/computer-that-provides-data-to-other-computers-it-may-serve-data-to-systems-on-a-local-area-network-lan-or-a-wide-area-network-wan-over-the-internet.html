<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-A server is a computer that provides data to other computers. It may serve data to systems on a local area network (LAN) or a wide area network (WAN) over the Internet. Many types of servers exist, including web servers, mail servers, and file servers. Each type runs software specific to the purpose of the server.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-A server is a computer program or device that provides a service to another computer program and its user, also known as the client. In a data center, the physical computer that a server program runs on is also frequently referred to as a server.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-LAN is a network that usually connects a small group of computers in a given geographical area. MAN is a comparatively wider network that covers large regions-like towns, cities, etc. The WAN network spans to an even larger locality. It has the capacity to connect various countries together.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-A wide-area network (WAN) is the technology that connects your offices, data centers, cloud applications, and cloud storage together. It is called a wide-area network because it spans beyond a single building or large campus to include multiple locations spread across a specific geographic area, or even the world.
