<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Transmission Media-Transmission media are the facilities used to interconnect computers in a network, such as twisted-pair wire, coaxial cable, and optical fiber cable. Transmission media are sometimes called transmission medium channels, links or lines.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Modem. Once you have your computer, you really donâ€™t need much additional hardware to connect to the Internet. The primary piece of hardware you need is a modem. The type of Internet access you choose will determine the type of modem you need.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-An Ethernet crossover cable is a crossover cable for Ethernet used to connect computing devices together directly. It is most often used to connect two devices of the same type, e.g. two computers (via their network interface controllers) or two switches to each other.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Physical topology and Logical topology diagrams. The physical topology diagrams identify the physical location of intermediary devices and cable installation. The Logical topology diagrams identify devices, addressing schemes, and ports.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Logical TopologyThe logical topology lets you see which end devices are connected towhich intermediary devices and what media is being used.
