<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-A local area network (LAN) is a computer network that interconnects computers within a limited area such as a residence, school, laboratory, university campus or office building.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Local Area Network (LAN) LANs connect groups of computers and low-voltage devices together across short distances (within a building or between a group of two or three buildings in close proximity to each other) to share information and resources.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-A metropolitan area network, or MAN, consists of a computer network across an entire city, college campus or small region. A MAN is larger than a LAN, which is typically limited to a single building or site.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-A Local Area Network (LAN) is a group of computer and peripheral devices which are connected in a limited area such as school, laboratory, home, and office building.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-LAN is a network that usually connects a small group of computers in a given geographical area. MAN is a comparatively wider network that covers large regions-like towns, cities, etc. The WAN network spans to an even larger locality. It has the capacity to connect various countries together.
