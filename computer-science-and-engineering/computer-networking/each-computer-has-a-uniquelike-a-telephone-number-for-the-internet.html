<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Computers connected to the Internet must speak the “Internet language” called the “Internet Protocol” or simply “IP.” Each computer is assigned a unique address somewhat similar to a street address or telephone number. Under the current system there are four numbers that range from 0 to 255 (Example: 206.156. 18.122).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-While each connected device has its own IP address, they are also included within the main IP address for your network. As described above, your public IP address is provided to your router by your ISP. Typically, ISPs have a large pool of IP addresses that they distribute to their customers.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-A Unique IP is an IP address that is specific to your domain. When you add hosting to a domain/subdomain, it’s assigned an IP on the Apache server which is shared with other sites. This shared IP address is most often the only IP you’ll need.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The IP address is a 32-bit number that uniquely identifies a network interface on a machine. An IP address is typically written in decimal digits, formatted as four 8-bit fields separated by periods. Each 8-bit field represents a byte of the IP address.
