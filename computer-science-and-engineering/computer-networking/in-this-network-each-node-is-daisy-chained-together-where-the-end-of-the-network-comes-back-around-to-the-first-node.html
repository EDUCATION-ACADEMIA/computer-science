<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-A bus network is a network topology in which nodes are connected in a daisy chain by a linear sequence of buses.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-What does it mean to daisy-chain monitors? Daisy-chaining monitors means to connect a series of display devices to a commuter using a cord connection from monitor to monitor in a series, rather than connecting each device directly to the computer.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Star topology has a central node or hub that connects to all other nodes in the network. Each node in the network is indirectly connected to other nodes using the central hub. Besides connecting all nodes, the central hub also acts as a repeater to ensure there is no loss in data transmission.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Daisy chain topology The two types of a daisy chain network topology are linear daisy chain and ring daisy chain. In the former, devices are linked in a straight line with two ‘ends, ’ similar to a bus topology. In the latter, a ‘ring’ of devices is formed.
