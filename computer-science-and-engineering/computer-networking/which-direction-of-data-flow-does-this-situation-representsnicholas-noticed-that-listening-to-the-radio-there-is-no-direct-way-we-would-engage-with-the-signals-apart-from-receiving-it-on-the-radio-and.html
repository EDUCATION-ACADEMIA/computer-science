In this mode, a sender can only send data but can not receive it. Similarly, a receiver can only receive data but can not send it.1)Simplex Mode: In simplex transmission mode, the communication between sender and receiver occurs in only one direction.

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-With simplex communication, all data flow is unidirectional: from the designated transmitter to the designated receiver.

<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Bidirectional flow of information from sender to receiver but only one at a time. Bidirectional information flow in both directions, from the sender to the receiver. A device can only send data but cannot receive it, or it can only receive data but cannot send it.

<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Simplex is the data transmission mode in which the data can flow only in one direction, i.e., the communication is unidirectional. In this mode, a sender can only send data but can not receive it. Similarly, a receiver can only receive data but can not send it.

<strong>Concept note-4:
