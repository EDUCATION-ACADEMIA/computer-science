<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Explanation: The use case is a template driven description of an interaction between an actor and the software.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-A use case is a written description of how users will perform tasks on your website. It outlines, from a user’s point of view, a system’s behavior as it responds to a request. Each use case is represented as a sequence of simple steps, beginning with a user’s goal and ending when that goal is fulfilled.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The use case approach focuses naturally on what the system does, not how it does it. This leads to ease of analysis and simplicity of design. A use case represents some usage of a system. For example, getting funds from a bank machine is one of several possible uses of the bank machine.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-In a use-case diagram, users of the system are depicted as actors. Each actor performs a specific role in the system, which is called a use-case. More than one actor can perform a single use-case. An actor can be a person, such as a customer, or a computer, such as a database system or server.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-A Use Case Model describes the proposed functionality of a new system. A Use Case represents a discrete unit of interaction between a user (human or machine) and the system. This interaction is a single unit of meaningful work, such as Create Account or View Account Details.
