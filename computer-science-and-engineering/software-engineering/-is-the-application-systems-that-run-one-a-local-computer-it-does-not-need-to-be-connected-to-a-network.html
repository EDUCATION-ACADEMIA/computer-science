<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Stand-alone applications: These are application systems that run on a local computer, such as a PC. They include all necessary functionality and do not need to be connected to a network. Examples of such applications are office applications, CAD programs, photo manipulation software, etc.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Desktop applications are software programs run locally on computer devices. They arenâ€™t accessible from a browser, like web-based apps, and require deployment on a personal computer or laptop.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Interactive transaction-based applications: These are applications that execute on a remote computer and that are accessed by users from their own PCs or terminals. Obviously, these include web applications such as e-commerce applications where the person can interact with a remote system to buy goods and services.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-An embedded control system (ECS) is a delicate system that provides specific control function to a larger system where the ECS is embedded. With the variety of control objectives, design of embedded control systems can be very different, and generally result in ad hoc designs.
