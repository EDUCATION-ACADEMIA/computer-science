<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-A software bug is an error, flaw or fault in the design, development, or operation of computer software that causes it to produce an incorrect or unexpected result, or to behave in unintended ways.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-We can say that a mistake made by a programmer during coding is called an error, an error found during the unit testing in the development phase is called a defect, an error found during the testing phase is called a bug and when an error is found at an end userâ€™s end is called as the failure.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-In computer technology, a bug is a coding error in a computer program. (We consider a program to also include the microcode that is manufactured into a microprocessor.)
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Software bugs occur as a result of undefined or continuously changing requirement, as well as software complexity, programming errors, deadlines, poor communication, reporting errors, and deviations. The lack of software glitches eliminates the need for testing.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-When requirements are implemented in the wrong way, and resulting a deviation in customer specifications which leads to a defect. A bug is an error in the software that causes malfunction. A flaw in the product that reduces its usability of the product.
