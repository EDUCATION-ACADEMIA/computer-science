</strong>
<p>(A) It is easy to understand 
</p>
<p>(B) Have requirements 
</p>
<p>(C) Little flexibility 
</p>
<p>(D) ** Testing is applied throughout

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-In Waterfall, you do requirements, design, implementation, verification and finally maintenance. In the same way, in V-model, you do requirements, design, implementation, verification and maintenance: same steps in both cases. The major differences with Waterfall are the way it is presented and the emphasis on testing.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-In the V-Model, the probability of total number of defects in the development of application is low as testing is done in parallel to the development. In the Waterfall Model, the probability of total number of defects in the development of application is high as testing is done post development.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-V Model is a highly disciplined SDLC model which has a testing phase parallel to each development phase. The V model is an extension of the waterfall model wherein software development and testing is executed in a sequential way. It is known as the Validation or Verification Model.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The W model is a straightforward successive approach in which the progress flows in just one direction. On the other hand, V Model, also called Verification and Validation Model, is like the waterfall model that takes a successive way of executing procedures.
