</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Defect Removal Efficiency relates to the ability to remove defects introduced to a system by a project during the project life cycle. At its simplest DRE can be expressed as a percentage where DRE = (total defects found during the project/total defects introduced by the project)x 100.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-DRE is calculated as the correlation of bugs detected internally (by testers and software testing) with the amount of bugs that were detected externally (by users). DRE’s formula: DRE= (Number of defects found internally/ Number of defects found internally + Number of defects found externally) × 100.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Defect Removal Efficiency (DRE) measures how well the development and testing team does at removing defects before they enter production.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Definition : The defect removal efficiency (DRE) gives a measure of the development team ability to remove defects prior to release. It is calculated as a ratio of defects resolved to total number of defects found. It is typically measured prior and at the moment of release.
