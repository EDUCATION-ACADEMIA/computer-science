<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The of a relationship is 0 if there is no explicit need for the relationship to occur or the relationship is optional. Explanation: The modality is 1 if an occurrence of the relationship is mandatory, else 0 for optional relationship.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-A value of zero indicates that there is no relationship between the two variables.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-It tells about the maximum number of associations between rows of tables. It tells about the minimum number of row associations in a table. There are different types − One−to−one, one−to−many, many−to−many. There are different types − Nullable and Not nullable.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Cardinality refers to the maximum number of times an instance in one entity can be associated with instances in the related entity. Modality refers to the minimum number of times an instance in one entity can be associated with an instance in the related entity.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The cardinality and modality are the concepts mainly used while designing a database and holds great importance. The cardinality describes the number of relations an object possesses for another object. On the other hand, modality describes whether the relation is required to be made or not.
