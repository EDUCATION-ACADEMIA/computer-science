<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Which of the following life cycle model can be chosen if the development team has less experience on similar projects? Explanation: Relying on risk assessment/analysis provides more flexibility than required for many applications which overcomes the criteria of less experienced developers.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-21. Which of the following models will not result in the desired output, when the user participation isn’t involved? RAD and prototyping are the models which are dependent upon the user’s participation and might produce undesired output.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The waterfall Model illustrates the software development process in a linear sequential flow. This means that any phase in the development process begins only if the previous phase is complete. In this waterfall model, the phases do not overlap.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Which of the following models is best suited when the requirements of the software are not decided and also the user is not sure about how he wants the user interface to look like? Explanation: It is recommended to use prototyping model in the following situations: Customer requirements are not clear and complete.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Commonly those include development, realisation, utilisation and disposal. The Life Cycle Model can be understood as an overall framework that defines criteria and expected results for each phase.
