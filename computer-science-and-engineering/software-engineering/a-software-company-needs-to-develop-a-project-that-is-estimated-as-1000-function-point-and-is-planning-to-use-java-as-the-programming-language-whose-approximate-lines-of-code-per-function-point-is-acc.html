<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Software projects under COCOMO model strategies are classified into 3 categories, organic, semi-detached, and embedded.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Calculate the effort estimate by multiplying the initial estimate with all the multiplying factors i.e., multiply the values in step1 and step2.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The basic COCOMO model assumes that effort and development time are functions of the product size alone.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Person Required = effort/time a, b, c, d are constants and have different values for different models. Time is the time required to develop the product and the unit is months. And the effort is the total effort calculated that will be required to complete the work calculated in PM (Person Months).
