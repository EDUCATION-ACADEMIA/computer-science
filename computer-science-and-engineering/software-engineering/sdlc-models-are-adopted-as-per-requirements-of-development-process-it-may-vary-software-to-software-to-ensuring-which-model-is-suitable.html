<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-8) SDLC Models are adopted as per requirements of development process. It may vary Software-to-software to ensuring which model is suitable. 9) We can select the best SDLC model if following are satisfied. A) If SDLC suitable for selected technology to implement the software.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-V-Shaped Model Like Waterfall, each stage begins only after the previous one has ended. This model is useful when there are no unknown requirements, as itâ€™s still difficult to go back and make changes.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-SDLC Models These models are also referred as Software Development Process Models". Each process model follows a Series of steps unique to its type to ensure success in the process of software development. Other related methodologies are Agile Model, RAD Model, Rapid Application Development and Prototyping Models.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-A software development life cycle (SDLC) model is a conceptual framework describing all activities in a software development project from planning to maintenance. This process is associated with several models, each including a variety of tasks and activities.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Waterfall Model-Application Requirements are very well documented, clear and fixed. Product definition is stable. Technology is understood and is not dynamic. There are no ambiguous requirements.
