<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The decomposition technique is most frequently used when estimating projects. Decomposition techniques use the divide and conquer approach. Estimating size, effort, and cost is performed in a stepwise manner by breaking down a project into the main functions or related software engineering activities.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The Project Estimation Approach that is widely used is Decomposition Technique. Decomposition techniques take a divide and conquer approach. Size, Effort and Cost estimation are performed in a stepwise manner by breaking down a Project into major Functions or related Software Engineering Activities.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Decomposition is one of the four cornerstones of Computer Science. It involves breaking down a complex problem or system into smaller parts that are more manageable and easier to understand. The smaller parts can then be examined and solved, or designed individually, as they are simpler to work with.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Decomposition is a general approach to solving a problem by breaking it up into smaller ones and solving each of the smaller ones separately, either in parallel or sequentially. (When it is done sequentially, the advantage comes from the fact that problem complexity grows more than linearly.)
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Project estimation techniques are tools that help project managers forecast cost, time and other variables as they relate to a forthcoming project. These estimation techniques allow for a more accurate forecast of key elements in every project and include cost, time, scope, risk, resource and quality.
