<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Requirements gathering-The developers discuss with the client and end users and know their expectations from the software. Organizing Requirements-The developers prioritize and arrange the requirements in order of importance, urgency and convenience.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The process to gather the software requirements from client, analyze and document them is known as requirement engineering. The goal of requirement engineering is to develop and maintain sophisticated and descriptive ‘System Requirements Specification’ document.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Requirements elicitation (also known as Requirements Gathering or Capture) is the process of generating a list of requirements (functional, system, technical, etc.) from the various stakeholders (customers, users, vendors, IT staff, etc.) that will be used as the basis for the formal Requirements Definition.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Business analyst and subject experts are responsible for requirement gathering process.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Requirement elicitation is the process of communicating and collaborating with key stakeholders to assemble the insight and identify the project’s needs.
