<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Graphical user interfaces are easier for most end users to understand as the icons and menus are generally self-explanatory and the GUI does not require the user to remember or input complex commands.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Here’s the definition: An intuitive interface is one that works the way the user expects it to. In other words, we find something intuitive when we don’t have to think about it. Thinking, as anyone studying for an exam can tell you, is hard. It takes energy and attention.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-An intuitive interface is an interface that works exactly as the user expects it to. For example, when a user sees a button, they assume that if they click that button it will perform a specific action. We don’t have to think about how that button works, we just know how it works.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Intuitive design means that when a user sees it, they know exactly what to do. Intuitive design is invisible. Design is intuitive when users can focus on a task at hand without stopping, even for a second. Intuitive designs direct people’s attention to tasks that are important.
