<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The Cause-Effect graph maps a set of causes to a set of effects, while the causes are the inputs to the program and the effects are the output. On the graph, the nodes on the left represent the cause and the ones on the right represent the effect.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Cause Effect Graph is a black box testing technique that graphically illustrates the relationship between a given outcome and all the factors that influence the outcome. It is also known as Ishikawa diagram as it was invented by Kaoru Ishikawa or fish bone diagram because of the way it looks.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Cause and Effect Analysis is a technique that helps you identify all the likely causes of a problem. This means that you can find and fix the main cause, first time around, without the problem running on and on.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-A Cause and Effect Diagram is a graphical tool for displaying a list of causes associated with a specific effect. It is also known as a fishbone diagram or an Ishikawa diagram (created by Dr. Kaoru Ishikawa, an influential quality management innovator). The graph organizes a list of potential causes into categories.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The cause-effect graph was created by Kaoru Ishikawa and thus, is known as the Ishikawa diagram. It is also known as the ‘fish-bone’ diagram because of the way it is structured. A cause-effect graph shows the relationship between an outcome (effect) and the factors (causes) that lead to it.
