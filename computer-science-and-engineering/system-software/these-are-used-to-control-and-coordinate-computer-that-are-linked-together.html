<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-An operating system is a types of system software that is a set of programs containing instructions that work together to coordinate all the activities among computer hardware resources.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Unlike operating systems, such as Windows, that are designed for single users to control one computer, network operating systems (NOS) coordinate the activities of multiple computers across a network. The network operating system acts as a director to keep the network running smoothly.
</p>

<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Drivers. In order for the operating system to talk to your hardware, it needs drivers. Drivers teach the operating system to interact with each bit of hardware. Graphics cards, sound cards, networking cards, USB peripherals, and everything else you connect to your computer relies on drivers.

<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The operating system (OS) manages all of the software and hardware on the computer. It performs basic tasks such as file, memory and process management, handling input and output, and controlling peripheral devices such as disk drives and printers.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-An operating system (OS) is the program that, after being initially loaded into the computer by a boot program, manages all of the other application programs in a computer. The application programs make use of the operating system by making requests for services through a defined application program interface (API).
