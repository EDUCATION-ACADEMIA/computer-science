<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-A warm boot (also called a “soft boot") is the process of restarting a computer. It may be used in contrast to a cold boot, which refers to starting up a computer that has been turned off. Warm boots are typically initiated by a “Restart” command in the operating system.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-A soft reboot is an action that uses a software to restart a computer without removing the computer’s power. Also known as a soft boot.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-If the computer locks up, a cold boot is necessary because a restart ("warm boot") may not be sufficient. A cold boot removes power and clears memory (RAM) of all internal data and counters that keep track of operations, which are created by the OS and applications when they run.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Warm Booting Warm Boot is also called soft boot. It refers to when we restart the computer. Here, the computer does not start from the initial state. When the system gets stuck sometimes it is required to restart it while it is ON.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-In computing, booting is the process of starting a computer as initiated via hardware such as a button or by a software command. After it is switched on, a computer’s central processing unit (CPU) has no software in its main memory, so some process must load software into memory before it can be executed.
