<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Multi threading + Operating systems that support multi threading have the ability to rotate between multiple threads (similar to the way multitasking can rotate between multiple programs) so that processing is completed faster and more efficiently, even though only one thread is executed by a single core at one time.
</p>

</strong>-Process method is similar to the multithreading method above where each Process is tagged to a function with its arguments. In the code snippet below, we can see that the time taken is longer for multiprocessing than multithreading since there is more overhead in running multiple processors.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Multiprocessing system allows executing multiple programs and tasks. Multithreading system executes multiple threads of the same or different processes. Less time is taken for job processing. A moderate amount of time is taken for job processing.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-One to One Model It supports multiple threads to execute in parallel on microprocessors. Disadvantage of this model is that creating user thread requires the corresponding Kernel thread.
