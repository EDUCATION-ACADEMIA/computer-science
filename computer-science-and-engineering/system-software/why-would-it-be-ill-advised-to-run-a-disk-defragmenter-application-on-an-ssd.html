<strong> Why would it be ill advised to run a disk defragmenter application on an SSD 
</strong>
<p>(A) SSDs have more moving parts so they wear more easily 
</p>
<p>(B) ** The location a file is stored on an SSD does not affect how quickly it can be accessed 
</p>
<p>(C) SSDs are fast enough it doesn’t matter 
</p>
<p>(D) ** Moving files physically on the SSD can contribute to wear and can reduce their lifespan

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-With a solid state drive however, it is recommended that you should not defragment the drive as it can cause unnecessary wear and tear which will reduce its life span. Nevertheless, because of the efficient way in which SSD technology functions, defragmentation to improve performance is not actually required.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-SSDs move data that’s already on your disk to other places on your disk, often sticking it at a temporary position first. That’s what gives defragmenting a disadvantage for SSD users. You’re writing data you already have, which uses up some of the NAND’s limited rewrite capability.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-If you defrag an SSD, then it could affect its service lifespan and shorten it. That’s because solid-state drives don’t have any moving mechanical parts similar to hard disks. Also, SSDs already have a better performance that they don’t need any extra step to further improve it.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Myth-Busting Hard Drive Defragmenting The idea behind that statement is that since you are rewriting files to the disk when you defragment, you are putting more wear and tear on the hard drive than necessary, thus shortening its lifespan. This is simply not true.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Defragmentation moves the pieces of the file next to each other. When the file is less fragmented, the hard drive’s read/write heads don’t have to move as much to access the data. This can improve the hard drive’s efficiency.
