<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-System software is a type of computer program that is designed to run a computer’s hardware and application programs. If we think of the computer system as a layered model, the system software is the interface between the hardware and user applications. The operating system is the best-known example of system software.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-System software is a program designed to run a computer’s hardware and applications and manage its resources, such as its memory, processors, and devices. It also provides a platform for running application software, and system software is typically bundled with a computer’s operating system.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Systems software includes the operating system and all the utilities that enable the computer to function. Applications software includes programs that do real work for users. For example, word processors, spreadsheets, and database management systems fall under the category of applications software.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-An operating system is the most important software that runs on a computer. It manages the computer’s memory and processes, as well as all of its software and hardware. It also allows you to communicate with the computer without knowing how to speak the computer’s language.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Software is a set of instructions, data or programs used to operate computers and execute specific tasks.
