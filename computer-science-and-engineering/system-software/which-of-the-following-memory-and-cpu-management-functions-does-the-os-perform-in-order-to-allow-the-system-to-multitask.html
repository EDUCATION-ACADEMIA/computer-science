<strong> Which of the following memory and CPU management functions does the OS perform in order to allow the system to multitask 
</strong>
<p>(A) ** Each application is allocated a different memory space so that their data does not interfere with each other 
</p>
<p>(B) ** The OS moves unused parts of memory to storage and swaps it out as necessary 
</p>
<p>(C) ** The OS splits CPU cycles up between open applications 
</p>
<p>(D) ** The OS Prioritises processes so that instructions are executed in an efficient order

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Through the use of regular interruption signals, the OS can prioritise and juggle the requests made to the processor. This gives the illusion that the CPU is actually dealing with more than one program or task at once (multitasking). Errors are spotted and usually dealt with without needing to alert the user.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-An Operating System (OS) is an interface between a computer user and computer hardware. An operating system is a software which performs all the basic tasks like file management, memory management, process management, handling input and output, and controlling peripheral devices such as disk drives and printers.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Memory management is the process of controlling and coordinating a computerâ€™s main memory. It ensures that blocks of memory space are properly managed and allocated so the operating system (OS), applications and other running processes have the memory they need to carry out their operations.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The memory management function keeps track of the status of each memory location, either allocated or free. It determines how memory is allocated among competing processes, deciding which gets memory, when they receive it, and how much they are allowed.
