<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Segmentation is a memory management technique which divides the program from the user’s view of memory. That means the program is divided into modules/segments, unlike paging in which the program was divided into different pages, and those pages may or may not be loaded into the memory simultaneously.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Paging. Paging is the memory management technique in which secondary memory is divided into fixed-size blocks called pages, and main memory is divided into fixed-size blocks called frames. The Frame has the same size as that of a Page.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The basic idea behind paging is to divide physical memory into a number of equal sized blocks called frames, and to divide a programs logical memory space into blocks of the same size called pages.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Definition. Fragmentation is a phenomenon in which storage space is used inefficiently, reducing capacity or performance and often both. Segmentation is the process of dividing the computer’s primary memory into segments or sections.
