<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-By definition, EOL operating systems will not get security fixes and updates that protect users against known vulnerabilities. Instead, these security risks will be known to the public, including hackers, but there will be no patch that can protect users against the risk where hackers decide to exploit it.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-As mentioned, end of life technology receives no security updates, bug fixes, or patches; it is dead in the eyes of the manufacturer. That means your security is completely compromised, not only for the system or software that is EOL, but also potentially for any others that connect to it.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-End-of-Life (EOL)/End-of-Support(EOS) describe the final stage of a productâ€™s lifecycle. Once a product reaches EOL/EOS, developers stop updating and patching the product and it is no longer maintained. Software development companies do this often as they release newer versions of their products.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-DOS does not support more than one program at a time.
