<strong> The operating system controls:memory managementmultitaskingperipheral management and driversuser managementfile managementWhich best describes multitasking? 
</strong>
<p>(A) The OS allocates memory between the different programs that are open at the same time.Programmers and users do not need to know where in memory data is being held 
</p>
<p>(B) ** The OS may allocate a small “time slice” to each separate process so that it appears that many processes are taking place at the same timeBy giving the processor a small time slice for each task means that all tasks appear to be executing at the same time.In reality resources such as memory and the processor are being shared between tasks. 
</p>
<p>(C) Operating Systems manage the way in which hardware interacts with softwareManaging all pieces of hardware that are not directly connected to the CPU-such as a keyboard, a mouse or even a hard disk drive.Allows devices to be disabled or updated. 
</p>
<p>(D) A piece of software used to control a piece of hardware.Allow a peripheral device to be connected to a computer and it be used by an Operating System.You may get them for graphics cards, mouse, sound card, network interface cards.

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The operating system determines how much memory the program requires, and allocates enough pages to hold it and its documents. When the program is closed, the allocated pages are freed up for use by other programs.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-To accommodate the allocation process, the OS continuously moves processes between memory and storage devices (hard disk or SSD), while tracking each memory location and its allocation status. The OS also determines which processes will get memory resources and when those resources will be allocated.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Multitasking in an OS enables a user to execute multiple computer tasks at the same time. Processes that hold common processing resources, such as a CPU, are known as many tasks. The operating system remembers where you are in these jobs and lets you switch between them without data being lost.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-An Operating System (OS) is an interface between a computer user and computer hardware. An operating system is a software which performs all the basic tasks like file management, memory management, process management, handling input and output, and controlling peripheral devices such as disk drives and printers.
