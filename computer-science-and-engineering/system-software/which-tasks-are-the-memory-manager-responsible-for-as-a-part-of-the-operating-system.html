<strong> Which tasks are the memory manager responsible for (as a part of the Operating System) 
</strong>
<p>(A) ** Swapping applications and data between RAM and virtual memory 
</p>
<p>(B) ** Allocated sections of memory to applications 
</p>
<p>(C) Communicating with peripheral devices connected to the computer 
</p>

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The memory management function keeps track of the status of each memory location, either allocated or free. It determines how memory is allocated among competing processes, deciding which gets memory, when they receive it, and how much they are allowed.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The Memory Manager manages memory in the system and is responsible for allocation and deallocation of memory, virtual memory management, etc. The File Manager manages the file system, and keeps track of directories, files, and related information.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The memory manager is responsible for protecting the memory allocated to each process from being corrupted by another process. If this is not ensured, then the system may exhibit unpredictable behavior. Memory managers should enable sharing of memory space between processes.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Memory management is the functionality of an operating system which handles or manages primary memory and moves processes back and forth between main memory and disk during execution.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The correct answer is Memory Management. Memory Management performs the task of allocation and deallocation of memory space to program.
