<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-It scrambles data into an unintelligible form that a user can decode or decrypt with the help of cryptographic keys. The primary goal of file encryption is to ensure that files are protected against malicious hackers.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-With data breaches and identity theft on the rise, encrypting files not only means protecting an organization’s reputation and trustworthiness-it means protecting people and their valuable assets. File encryption is also a key pillar of cybersecurity, with national and global policies requiring its use.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Encrypting information protects files from breaches in confidentiality, but the risks of unauthorized or accidental modification (including destruction) and/or denial of use are still real.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Encryption with the private key is used to prove authenticity. If person 1 encrypts a message with their own private key then person 2 can decrypt it with person 1’s public key, which proves that person 1 originated the message since it could only have been encrypted with their private key.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Encrypting personal data whilst it is being transferred provides effective protection against interception by a third party. You should use encrypted communications channels when transmitting any personal data over an untrusted network.
