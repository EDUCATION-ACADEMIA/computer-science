<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-An incremental backup is a backup type that only copies data that has been changed or created since the previous backup activity was conducted. An incremental backup approach is used when the amount of data that has to be protected is too voluminous to do a full backup of that data every day.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-An incremental cloud backup stores only data and files that have been modified since the previous backup was conducted. The sole purpose of incremental file backup is to capture any changes that have happened since the last archive.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Incremental backups An incremental backup operation will result in copying only the data that has changed since the last backup operation of any type. An organization typically uses the modified time stamp on files and compares it to the time stamp of the last backup.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Differential Backup This type of backup involves backing up data that was created or changed since the last full backup. To put it simply, a full backup is done initially, and then subsequent backups are run to include all the changes made to the files and folders.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Full backup-every file is backed up. Usually, this is done weekly. Differential-backs up the files that have been changed since the last full backup. Incremental-only backs up the files that have been changed since the last incremental or full backup.
