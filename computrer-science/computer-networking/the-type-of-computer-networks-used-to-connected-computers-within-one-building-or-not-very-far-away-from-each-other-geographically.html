<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-A Local Area Network (LAN) is a network that is confined to a relatively small area. It is generally limited to a geographic area such as a writing lab, school, or building. Computers connected to a network are broadly categorized as servers or workstations.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Local Area Network (LAN) LANs connect groups of computers and low-voltage devices together across short distances (within a building or between a group of two or three buildings in close proximity to each other) to share information and resources.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Local Area Network (LAN) A LAN network connects a group of computers and peripheral devices in a specific area, such as a school, laboratory, home, or office building. This type of computer network is a popular way to share resources such as files, printers, games, and other applications.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-LAN (local area network): A LAN connects computers over a relatively short distance, allowing them to share data, files, and resources. For example, a LAN may connect all the computers in an office building, school, or hospital.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-A metropolitan area network (MAN) is a computer network that is larger than a single building local area network (LAN) but is located in a single geographic area that is smaller than a wide area network (WAN).
