<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Hub. Hubs connect multiple computer networking devices together. A hub also acts as a repeater in that it amplifies signals that deteriorate after traveling long distances over connecting cables.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Router. A router is a hardware device that allows you to connect several computers and other devices to a single Internet connection, which is known as a home network. Many routers are wireless, which allows you to create a home wireless network, commonly known as a Wi-Fi network.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The correct answer is the hub. An Ethernet hub, active hub, network hub, repeater hub, multiport repeater, or simply hub is a network hardware device for connecting multiple Ethernet devices together and making them act as a single network segment.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-A switch is a device in a computer network that connects other devices together. Multiple data cables are plugged into a switch to enable communication between different networked devices.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Routers. A router is a communications device that connects multiple computers or other routers together and transmits data to its correct desti-nation on the network. A router can be used on any size of network.
