<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-A Local Area Network (LAN) is a network that is confined to a relatively small area. It is generally limited to a geographic area such as a writing lab, school, or building. Computers connected to a network are broadly categorized as servers or workstations.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-local area network (LAN) A local area network (LAN) is a group of computers and peripheral devices that share a common communications line or wireless link to a server within a distinct geographic area.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-A local area network (LAN) is a computer network that interconnects computers within a limited area such as a residence, school, laboratory, university campus or office building.
