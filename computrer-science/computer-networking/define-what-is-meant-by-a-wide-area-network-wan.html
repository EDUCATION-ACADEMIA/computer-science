<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-A wide area network (also known as WAN), is a large network of information that is not tied to a single location. WANs can facilitate communication, the sharing of information and much more between devices from around the world through a WAN provider.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-A wide-area network (WAN) is the technology that connects your offices, data centers, cloud applications, and cloud storage together. It is called a wide-area network because it spans beyond a single building or large campus to include multiple locations spread across a specific geographic area, or even the world.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-A network consists of two or more computers that are linked in order to share resources (such as printers and CDs), exchange files, or allow electronic communications. The computers on a network may be linked through cables, telephone lines, radio waves, satellites, or infrared light beams.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-A wide area network (WAN) is a large computer network that connects groups of computers over large distances. WANs are often used by large businesses to connect their office networks; each office typically has its own local area network, or LAN, and these LANs connect via a WAN.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-WANs are often built using leased lines. At each end of the leased line, a router connects the LAN on one side with a second router within the LAN on the other.
