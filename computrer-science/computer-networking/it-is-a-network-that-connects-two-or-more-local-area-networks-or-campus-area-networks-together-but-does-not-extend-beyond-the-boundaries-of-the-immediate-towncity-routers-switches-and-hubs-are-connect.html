<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Metropolitan Area Network: A Metropolitan Area Network is a network that connects two or more Local Area Networks or Campus Area Networks together but does not extend beyond the boundaries of the immediate town, city, or metropolitan area.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-A wide area network (WAN) is any network that extends over a large geographic area, usually connecting multiple local area networks (LANs).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-A wide area network (WAN) is a geographically distributed private telecommunications network that interconnects multiple local area networks (LANs). A LAN is a group of computers and network devices which are all connected to each other, typically from within a short relative geographical distance.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-A wide area network (WAN) is a series of LANs linked together to form a network in an extended area. WANs are typically operated by telecommunications companies or businesses that need a network comprising multiple remote locations. The internet itself is a WAN.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-LAN is a network that usually connects a small group of computers in a given geographical area. MAN is a comparatively wider network that covers large regions-like towns, cities, etc. The WAN network spans to an even larger locality. It has the capacity to connect various countries together.
