<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS) is the secure version of HTTP, which is the primary protocol used to send data between a web browser and a website. HTTPS is encrypted in order to increase security of data transfer.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-A peer-to-peer network (or workgroup) consists of multiple Windows computers that share information. No computer on the network serves as a central authoritative source of user information. Each computer maintains a separate list of users and groups in its own SAM database.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and its successor, Transport Layer Security (TLS), provide a way to encrypt a communication channel between two computers over the Internet. In most cases, the terms SSL and TLS can be used interchangeably unless youâ€™re referring to a specific version of the protocol.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-In a peer-to-peer network, computers on the network are equal, with each workstation providing access to resources and data. This is a simple type of network where computers are able to communicate with one another and share what is on or attached to their computer with other users.
