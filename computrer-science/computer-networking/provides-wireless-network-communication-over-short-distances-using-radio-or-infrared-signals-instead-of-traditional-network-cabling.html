<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-WiFi is a type of wireless networking that uses radio frequencies to send and receive data. WiFi allows users to connect to the Internet at high speeds without the necessity of cables. WiFi stands for “wireless fidelity” and is a phrase that is often used to refer to wireless networking technologies.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-A wireless LAN (WLAN) is a wireless computer network that links two or more devices using wireless communication to form a local area network (LAN) within a limited area such as a home, school, computer laboratory, campus, office building etc.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-A peer-to-peer (P2P) network allows wireless devices to directly communicate with each other. Wireless devices within range of each other can discover and communicate directly, without involving central access points.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-A personal area network (PAN) interconnects technology devices, typically within the range of a single user, which is approximately 10 meters or 33 feet.
