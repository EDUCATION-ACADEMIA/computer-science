<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The client-server architecture refers to a system that hosts, delivers, and manages most of the resources and services that the client requests. In this model, all requests and services are delivered over a network, and it is also referred to as the networking computing model or client server network.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-A client-server network is a communications architecture in which clients receive resources and services from a dedicated host over a local area network (LAN) or a wide-area network (WAN), such as the Internet.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-client-server architecture, architecture of a computer network in which many clients (remote processors) request and receive service from a centralized server (host computer). Client computers provide an interface to allow a computer user to request services of the server and to display the results the server returns.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-In the peer-to-peer network model, each computer system can act as a client and a server. In the client-server network model, there is a centralized server. In the P2P network model, each computer system stores individual files and data.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Client server architecture is a computing model in which the server hosts, delivers, and manages most of the resources and services requested by the client. It is also known as the networking computing model or client server network as all requests and services are delivered over a network.
