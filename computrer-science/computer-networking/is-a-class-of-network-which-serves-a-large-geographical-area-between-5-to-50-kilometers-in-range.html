<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-A Metropolitan Area Network is a class of network which serves a large geographical area between 5 to 50 kilometers in range. This geographical area can include several buildings, such as a college campus, sometimes referred to as a campus network, or an area as large as a city (metropolitan area).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Metropolitan area networks for organizations It is larger than a LAN in a single building but not large enough to be considered a WAN. The size usually ranges from 5 kilometers to 50 km.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-LAN is a network that usually connects a small group of computers in a given geographical area. MAN is a comparatively wider network that covers large regions-like towns, cities, etc. The WAN network spans to an even larger locality. It has the capacity to connect various countries together.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-A WAN network will have a larger coverage area that can range up to 100, 000 KM and in some cases, stretches globally or over international borders. A LAN network is limited to between 100-1000 meters coverage. A MAN network is will usually stretch up to an area of 100 KM.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Characteristics of MAN Here are important characteristics of the MAN network: It mostly covers towns and cities in a maximum 50 km range. Mostly used medium is optical fibers, cables. Data rates adequate for distributed computing applications.
