<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-What is a Topology? The physical topology of a network refers to the configuration of cables, computers, and other peripherals. Physical topology should not be confused with logical topology which is the method used to pass information between workstations. Logical topology was discussed in the Protocol chapter.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Physical network topology is the placement of the various components of a network and the different connectors usually represent the physical network cables, and the nodes represents usually the physical network devices (like switches).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-A network topology is the physical and logical arrangement of nodes and connections in a network. Nodes usually include devices such as switches, routers and software with switch and router features. Network topologies are often represented as a graph.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Physical topology in which computers, peripheral and network devices are connected independently with a central device. computers and peripheral and network devices are connected into two or more star topology networks and then the central components are interconnected over a bus.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Physical – The physical network topology refers to the actual connections (wires, cables, etc.) of how the network is arranged.
