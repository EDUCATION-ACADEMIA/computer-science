<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Some examples of a multi-user OS are Unix, Ubuntu, MacOS, Windows and all Linux based OS. Multi-user operating systems were originally used for time-sharing and batch processing on mainframe computers.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-A Single-User Operating System is a system in which only one user can access the computer system at a time. A Multi-User Operating System is a system that allows more than one user to access a computer system at one time. The bootloader loads all the resources of the CPU in the profile of a single superuser.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Multitasking has the same meaning of multiprogramming but in a more general sense, as it refers to having multiple (programs, processes, tasks, threads) running at the same time. This term is used in modern operating systems when multiple tasks share a common processing resource (e.g., CPU and Memory).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Microsoft’s Windows and Apple’s macOS platforms are both examples of operating systems that lets a single user have several applications in operation at the same time.
