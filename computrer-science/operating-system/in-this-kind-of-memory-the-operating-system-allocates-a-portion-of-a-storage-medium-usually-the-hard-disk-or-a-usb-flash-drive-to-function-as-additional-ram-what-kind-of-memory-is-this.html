<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-With virtual memory, the operating system allocates a portion of a storage medium, usually the hard disk, to function as additional RAM. As you interact with a program, part of it may be in physical RAM, while the rest of the program is on the hard disk as virtual memory.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-A system using virtual memory uses a section of the hard drive to emulate RAM. With virtual memory, a system can load larger or multiple programs running at the same time, enabling each one to operate as if it has more space, without having to purchase more RAM.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Answer: Virtual memory is the answer buddy.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Random access memory RAM is used to hold data and instructions that are currently in use. In a modern PC, RAM is used to hold the operating system and any open documents and programs that are running. RAM can be read from and written to.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The Kernel remains in the memory until the Operating System is shut-down. The Kernel is responsible for low-level tasks such as disk management, memory management, task management, etc. It provides an interface between the user and the hardware components of the system.
