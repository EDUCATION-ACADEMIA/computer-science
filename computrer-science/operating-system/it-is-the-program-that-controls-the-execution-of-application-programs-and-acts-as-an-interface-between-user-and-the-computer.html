<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-An operating system is a program that acts as an interface between the computer user and computer hardware, and controls the execution of programs.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Operating System (OS)-a set of programs that manage computer hardware resources and provide common services for application software. The operating system acts as an interface between the hardware and the programs requesting I/O. It is the most fundamental of all system software programs.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-An Operating System (OS) is an interface between a computer user and computer hardware. An operating system is a software which performs all the basic tasks like file management, memory management, process management, handling input and output, and controlling peripheral devices such as disk drives and printers.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-System software is a type of computer program that is designed to run a computerâ€™s hardware and application programs. If we think of the computer system as a layered model, the system software is the interface between the hardware and user applications.
