<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-A Firewall is a network security device that monitors and filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on an organization’s previously established security policies. At its most basic, a firewall is essentially the barrier that sits between a private internal network and the public Internet.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Firewalls. Firewalls are one of the most fundamental network security appliances. Like many other security devices, firewalls can come in hardware or software forms. Most of the time, businesses choose to use dedicated, specialized hardware since it can handle more traffic and has better vendor support.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-A firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. Either hardware, software, or a combination of both, the firewall establishes a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks such as the Internet.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-It filters traffic based on state, port, and protocol, along with administrator-defined rules and context. This involves using data from prior connections and packets from the same connection. Most firewalls rely on stateful packet inspection to keep track of all internal traffic.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Stateful inspection firewalls – also known as dynamic packet-filtering firewalls – monitor communication packets over time and examine both incoming and outgoing packets. This type maintains a table that keeps track of all open connections.
