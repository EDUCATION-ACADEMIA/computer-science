<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Decomposition: Breaking down a large problem into smaller sub-problems. programs. You can think about using functions in programming to help decompose the program. Algorithm: Steps to provide a solution to a problem, usually represented in flowcharts or pseudocode.

<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Decomposition is when we break a problem or task down into smaller parts to make it easier to tackle. Sometimes the problem is so big or so tricky that we donâ€™t know where to start. Breaking it down or decomposing it can make it easier to manage.

<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Decomposition involves breaking down a complex problem or system into smaller parts that are more manageable and easier to understand. The smaller parts can then be examined and solved, or designed, individually, as they are simpler to work with. If a problem is not decomposed, it is much harder to solve.
