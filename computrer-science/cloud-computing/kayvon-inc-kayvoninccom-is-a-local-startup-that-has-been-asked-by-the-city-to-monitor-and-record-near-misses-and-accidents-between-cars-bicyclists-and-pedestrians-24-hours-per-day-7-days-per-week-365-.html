<title>Kayvon Inc. (KayvonInc.com) is a local startup that has been asked by the city to monitor and record near misses and accidents between cars, bicyclists and pedestrians 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, 365 days per year. Kayvon Inc. (KI) is planning to deploy video cameras and dedicated computing at each busy intersection in the city. KI plans to capture video at a sustained frame grab rate of 20 frames per second, 24 hours per day. They will provide privacy to drivers, cyclists and pedestrians by denaturing the video at the intersection, before it is stored. Since the bandwidth from the intersection to the cloud is limited, KI plans to process the streams of data at the intersection to identify near misses and accidents. They will then send the data for just the interesting cases to the cloud for storage and potential further analysis.
