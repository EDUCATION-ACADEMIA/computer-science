<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Community cloud is a cloud infrastructure that allows systems and services to be accessible by a group of several organizations to share the information. It is owned, managed, and operated by one or more organizations in the community, a third party, or a combination of them.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The private cloud can be physically located at your organizationâ€™s on-site datacenter, or it can be hosted by a third-party service provider. But in a private cloud, the services and infrastructure are always maintained on a private network and the hardware and software are dedicated solely to your organization.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The community cloud allows systems and services to be accessible by a group of organizations.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-A hybrid cloud is a type of cloud computing that combines on-premises infrastructure-or a private cloud-with a public cloud. Hybrid clouds allow data and apps to move between the two environments.
