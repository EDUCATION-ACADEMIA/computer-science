<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-SaaS applications are sometimes called Web-based software, on-demand software, or hosted software. Whatever the name, SaaS applications run on a SaaS provider’s servers. The provider manages access to the application, including security, availability, and performance.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-SaaS works through the cloud delivery model. A software provider will either host the application and related data using its own servers, databases, networking and computing resources, or it may be an ISV that contracts a cloud provider to host the application in the provider’s data center.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-SaaS, or software as a service, is on-demand access to ready-to-use, cloud-hosted application software.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-SaaS is a method of software delivery that allows data to be accessed from any device with an internet connection and a web browser. In this web-based model, software vendors host and maintain the servers, databases, and the code that makes up an application.
