<strong> A student wants to create an algorithm that can determine, given any program and program input, whether or not the program will go into an infinite loop for that input. The problem the student is attempting to solve is considered an undecidable problem. Which of the following is true? 
</strong>
<p>(A) It is possible to create an algorithm that will solve the problem for all programs and inputs, but thealgorithm can only be implemented in a low-level programming language. 
</p>
<p>(B) It is possible to create an algorithm that will solve the problem for all programs and inputs, but thealgorithm requires simultaneous execution on multiple CPUs. 
</p>
<p>(C) It is possible to create an algorithm that will solve the problem for all programs and inputs, but thealgorithm will not run in reasonable time. 
</p>
<p>(D) ** It is not possible to create an algorithm that will solve the problem for all programs and inputs.

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Which of the following best explains the ability to solve problems algorithmically? Any problem can be solved algorithmically, though some algorithmic solutions may require humans to validate the results.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Which of the following best explains why it is not possible to use computers to solve every problem? Current computer processing capabilities cannot improve significantly. Large-scale problems require a crowdsourcing model, which is limited by the number of people available to work on the problem.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Which of the following best describes the growth in the number of registered users for the first eight years of the application’s existence? The number of registered users about doubled each year for years 1 to 5 and then increased at about a constant rate after that.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The main advantage of a Hexadecimal Number is that it is very compact and by using a base of 16 means that the number of digits used to represent a given number is usually less than in binary or decimal. Also, it is quick and easy to convert between hexadecimal numbers and binary.
