<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Heuristics methodology for problem-solving is most useful when there is little or no time to solve the said problem and it is okay to use approximations. Hence the correct answer is C.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Under which of the following conditions is it most beneficial to use a heuristic approach to solve a problem? When the problem can be solved in a reasonable time and an approximate solution is acceptable.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-3. Which of the following activities is most likely to be successful as a citizen science project? Collecting pictures of plants from around the world that can be analyzed to look for regional differences in plant growth.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Metadata is the “data about the data”, which includes various information about the data assets, such as the type, format, structure, author, date created, date modified and file size.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-In information technology, lossy compression or irreversible compression is the class of data compression methods that uses inexact approximations and partial data discarding to represent the content. These techniques are used to reduce data size for storing, handling, and transmitting content.
