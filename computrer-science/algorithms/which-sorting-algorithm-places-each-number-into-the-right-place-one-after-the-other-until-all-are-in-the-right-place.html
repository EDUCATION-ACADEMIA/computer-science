Yes, Insertion sort is both an inplace and a stable algorithm. Insertion sort is a stable algorithm since equal elements remain the same in the sorted array as that of the unsorted array.

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Insertion sort is a sorting algorithm in which the given array is divided into a sorted and an unsorted section. In each iteration, the element to be inserted has to find its optimal position in the sorted subsequence and is then inserted while shifting the remaining elements to the right.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Ans. Yes, Insertion sort is both an inplace and a stable algorithm. Insertion sort is a stable algorithm since equal elements remain the same in the sorted array as that of the unsorted array. It is also an inplace algorithm as only a constant number of extra variables is used to store the current element.

<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Insertion sort is a sorting algorithm that places an unsorted element at its suitable place in each iteration.
