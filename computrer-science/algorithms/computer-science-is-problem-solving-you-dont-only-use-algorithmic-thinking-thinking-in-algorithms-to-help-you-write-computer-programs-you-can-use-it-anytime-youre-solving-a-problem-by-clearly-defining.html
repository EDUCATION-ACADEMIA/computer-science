<title>Computer science is problem solving. You dont only use algorithmic thinking, thinking in algorithms, to help you write computer programs. You can use it anytime youre solving a problem by clearly defining all the steps to develop a solution that will work every time. Giving someone directions to play a card game is one example.Another example is helping someone whos lost by providing directions to where they need to go. If youre writing or following steps in order, youre using an algorithm. Its not just something computers do.The author of this passage would most likely agree with which of the following statements?

<strong> Computer science is problem solving. You don’t only use algorithmic thinking, thinking in algorithms, to help you write computer programs.

If you’re writing or following steps in order, you’re using an algorithm. It’s not just something computers do.The author of this passage would most likely agree with which of the following statements? 
</strong>
<p>(A) To solve problems, people should rely more on creativity than on algorithmic thinking. 
</p>
<p>(B) Algorithmic thinking limits what computers can do or solve. 
</p>
<p>(C) Algorithmic thinking is mostly useful for computer programmers.

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Algorithmic Thinking Definition. Algorithmic thinking is a derivative of computer science and coding. This approach automates the problem-solving process by creating a series of systematic logical steps that process a defined set of inputs and produce a defined set of outputs based on these.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-An algorithm is a method or a process followed to solve a problem. If the problem is viewed as a function, then an algorithm is an implementation for the function that transforms an input to the corresponding output. A problem can be solved by many different algorithms.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-An algorithm must be general. This means that it must solve every instance of the problem. For example, a program that computes the area of a rectangle should work on all possible dimensions of the rectangle, within the limits of the programming language and the machine.
