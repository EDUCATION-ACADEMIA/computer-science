<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Speedup: We can compute the speedup of a parallel solution by dividing the time it took to do the task sequentially by the time it took to complete the task in parallel.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-In sequential computing, operations are performed in order one at a time. In parallel computing, the program is broken into smaller steps, some of which are performed at the same time.

<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Understanding Using Sequential and Parallel Processing In sequential processing, the subscribing system processes messages defined in inbound service operations in the order received. In parallel processing, the subscribing system processes messages defined in service operations in parallel, in no specific sequence.

<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The standard programming model is sequential computing: the computer executes each operation of the program in order, one at a time.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-We can measure the gains by calculating the speedup: the time taken by the sequential solution divided by the time taken by the distributed parallel solution. If a sequential solution takes 60 minutes and a distributed solution takes 6 minutes, the speedup is 10.
