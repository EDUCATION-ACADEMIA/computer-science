<strong> A school is creating class schedules for its students.

Instead they have decided to use a simpler algorithm that produces a good but non-optimal schedule in a more reasonable amount of time.Which principle does this decision best demonstrate? 
</strong>
<p>(A) Unreasonable algorithms may sometimes also be undecidable 
</p>
<p>(B) ** Heuristics can be used to solve some problems for which no reasonable algorithm exists 
</p>
<p>(C) Two algorithms that solve the same problem must also have the same efficiency 
</p>
<p>(D) Approximate solutions are often identical to optimal solutions

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Explanation: The principle that this kind of decision demonstrate is Heuristics, this is because Heuristics can be used to solve problems when there is no known algorithm to resolve the problem.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Question: Which of the following is true of two algorithms designed to solve the same problem? If two algorithms solve the same problem they must have the same efficiency.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Algorithms with exponential or factorial efficiencies are examples of algorithms that run in an unreasonable amount of time.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Which of the following are true statements about how the Internet enables crowdsourcing? The Internet can provide crowdsourcing participants access to useful tools, information and professional knowledge that couldn’t be easily accessed before the Internet.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-➢ An algorithm is a finite set of instructions that accomplishes a particular task. ➢ In addition, all algorithms must satisfy the following criteria: ➢ An algorithm is composed of a finite set of steps, each of which may require one or more operations.
