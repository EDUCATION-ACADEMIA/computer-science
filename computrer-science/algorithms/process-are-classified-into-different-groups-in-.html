<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Processes are classified into totally different groups in multilevel Queue scheduling. Explanation: It may happen that processes within the ready queue may be divided into totally different categories wherever every category has its own scheduling desires.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Multilevel queue scheduling is a type of CPU scheduling in which the processes in the ready state are divided into different groups, each group having its own scheduling needs.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The multilevel queue scheduling method has divided the ready queue into seven separate queues. Depending on their priority, such as memory capacity, process priority, or kind, these processes are each given a queue. Each queueâ€™s scheduling process is unique.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-All ready-state queue processes can be classified into different classes in multiple-level queue scheduling. Each class can follow its scheduling algorithm based on its requirements. Note: This scheduling can be preemptive or non-preemptive, depending on the conditions of the processes.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Multilevel queue scheduling is used when processes in the ready queue can be divided into different classes where each class has its own scheduling needs. For instance, foreground or interactive processes and background or batch processes are commonly divided.
