<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The register which stores the address of the next instruction is called the program counter. Usually after each instruction is executed, the program counter increases by one (hence the use of the word counter) so that it contains the address of the next instruction.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Program counter It is a 16-bit register used to store the memory address location of the next instruction to be executed. Microprocessor increments the program whenever an instruction is being executed, so that the program counter points to the memory address of the next instruction that is going to be executed.
