<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Most CPU chips also include some Very fast memory which is used as an intermediary between the processor and the main memory. Stores the most frequently or most recently used instructions and data so that they might be retrieved quickly.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-A data bus can transfer data to and from the memory of a computer, or into or out of the central processing unit (CPU) that acts as the device’s “engine."Hence, Option 3 is correct.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Cache memory is a chip-based computer component that makes retrieving data from the computer’s memory more efficient. It acts as a temporary storage area that the computer’s processor can retrieve data from easily.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-In computing, the instruction register (IR) or current instruction register (CIR) is the part of a CPU’s control unit that holds the instruction currently being executed or decoded.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Cache memory holds frequently used instructions/data which the processor may require next and it is faster access memory than RAM, since it is on the same chip as the processor. This reduces the need for frequent slower memory retrievals from main memory, which may otherwise keep the CPU waiting.
