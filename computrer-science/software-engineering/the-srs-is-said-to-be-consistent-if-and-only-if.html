<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The Software Requirement Specification (SRS) is said to be consistent if and only if no subset of individual requirements described in it conflict with each other.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Consistency: The SRS is consistent if, and only if, no subset of individual requirements described in its conflict.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Explanation: SRS is said to be correct if it covers all the requirements that are actually expected from the system. Requirements in SRS are said to be consistent if there are no conflicts between any set of requirements.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-SRS is correct if it meets all of the system’s requirements. The SRS is considered unambiguous or precise if all requirements have only one interpretation.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Software Requirements Specifications, also known as SRS, is the term used to describe an in-depth description of a software product to be developed. It’s considered one of the initial stages of the software development lifecycle (SDLC). Think of it like the map that points you to your finished product.
