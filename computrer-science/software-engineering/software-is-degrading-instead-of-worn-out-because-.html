<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Software suffers from exposure to hostile environments. Defects are more likely to arise after software has been used often. Multiple change requests introduce errors in component interactions. Software spare parts become harder to order.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Software doesn’t wear out. However, it does deteriorate with maintenance as shown below. During its life, software will undergo changes and it is likely that some new defects will be introduced as a result of this, causing the failure rate curve to spike as shown above.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Several factors are responsible for software rot, including changes to the environment in which the software operates, degradation of compatibility between parts of the software itself, and the appearance of bugs in unused or rarely used code.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-When something is no longer of any use, it reaches the “wear out” state. That is, it can not perform the function it was built for. For example, a printer reaches “wear out” state it can’t print anymore.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The characteristics of software include: It is intangible, meaning it cannot be seen or touched. It is non-perishable, meaning it does not degrade over time. It is easy to replicate, meaning it can be copied and distributed easily.
