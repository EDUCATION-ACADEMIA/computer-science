<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The waterfall model is a sequential development approach, in which development is seen as flowing steadily downwards (like a waterfall) through several phases, typically: Requirements analysis resulting in a software requirements specification. Software design. Implementation.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Winston Royce introduced the Waterfall Model in 1970.This model has five phases: Requirements analysis and specification, design, implementation, and unit testing, integration and system testing, and operation and maintenance. The steps always follow in this order and do not overlap.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Requirements: The first phase involves understanding what needs to design and what is its function, purpose, etc. Here, the specifications of the input and output or the final product are studied and marked.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The waterfall model is a linear, sequential approach to the software development lifecycle (SDLC) that is popular in software engineering and product development. The waterfall model uses a logical progression of SDLC steps for a project, similar to the direction water flows over the edge of a cliff.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The Waterfall Model was the first Process Model to be introduced. It is also referred to as a linear-sequential life cycle model. It is very simple to understand and use. In a waterfall model, each phase must be completed before the next phase can begin and there is no overlapping in the phases.
