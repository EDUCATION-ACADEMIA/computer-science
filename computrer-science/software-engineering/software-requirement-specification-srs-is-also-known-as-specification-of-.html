<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The SRS document should view the system to be developed as a black box, and should specify the externally visible behavior of the system. Hence the SRS document produced at the end of the requirement analysis phase is called the black-box specification.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Software Requirements Specifications, also known as SRS, is the term used to describe an in-depth description of a software product to be developed. It’s considered one of the initial stages of the software development lifecycle (SDLC). Think of it like the map that points you to your finished product.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The SRS report should view the system to be developed as a black box and should define the externally visible behavior of the system. For this reason, the SRS report is also known as the black-box specification of a system.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The SRS document is also known as specification. Explanation: The system is considered as a black box whose internal details are not known that is, only its visible external (input/output) behavior is documented.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Specification-based testing technique is also known as ‘black-box’ or input/output driven testing techniques because they view the software as a black-box with inputs and outputs. The testers have no knowledge of how the system or component is structured inside the box.
