<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The class diagram is a central modeling technique that runs through nearly all object-oriented methods. This diagram describes the types of objects in the system and various kinds of static relationships which exist between them.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-A static model describes the static structure of the system being modeled, which is considered less likely to change than the functions of the system.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Class diagrams are fundamental to the object modeling process and model the static structure of a system.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-UML diagrams A Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagram provides a visual representation of an aspect of a system. UML diagrams illustrate the quantifiable aspects of a system that can be described visually, such as relationships, behavior, structure, and functionality.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Use-Case diagram is the UML diagrams which has a static view. The Use-Case diagram is the appropriate answer as a result. Use case diagrams just show the systemâ€™s features, whereas dynamic models/views show all behaviors and functions.
