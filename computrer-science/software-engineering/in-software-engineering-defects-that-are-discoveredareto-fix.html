<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Furthermore, the later defects are discov-ered in a software product, the more expensive they are to fix (the Defect Cost Increase (DCI) Principle). Iterative development overcomes these problems by maintaining a tight feedback loop.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Earlier the defect is found lesser is the cost of defect. For example if error is found in the requirement specifications during requirements gathering and analysis, then it is somewhat cheap to fix it.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-For bug fixes, earlier is better (and cheaper) During the development process, it is more cost-effective and efficient to fix bugs in earlier stages rather than later ones. The cost of fixing an issue increases exponentially as the software moves forward in the SDLC.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Earlier, the Defect is detected and removed, the lower the overall cost of quality will be. The cost of quality is minimized when the defect is removed in the same phase in which it was introduced.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The software engineering process consists of activities for managing the creation of software, including requirement collection, analysis, design, coding, testing, and maintenance.
