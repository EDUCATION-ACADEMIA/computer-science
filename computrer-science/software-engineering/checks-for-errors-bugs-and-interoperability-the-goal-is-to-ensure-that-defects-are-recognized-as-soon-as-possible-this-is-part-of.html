<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Mutation Testing: In mutation testing, the application is tested for the code that was modified after fixing a particular bug/defect.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Confirmation testing is testing to establish whether any defects have been introduced as a result of changes and Regression testing is testing fixes to a set of defects.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Regression testing is performed to verify that a fixed bug hasn’t resulted in another functionality or business rule violation. The intent of regression testing is to ensure that a change, such as a bug fix should not result in another fault being uncovered in the application.
