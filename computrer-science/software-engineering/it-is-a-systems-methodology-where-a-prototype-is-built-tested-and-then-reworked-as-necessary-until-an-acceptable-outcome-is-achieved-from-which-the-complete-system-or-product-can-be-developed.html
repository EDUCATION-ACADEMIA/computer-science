<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-What is Prototyping Model? Prototyping Model is a software development model in which prototype is built, tested, and reworked until an acceptable prototype is achieved. It also creates base to produce the final system or software. It works best in scenarios where the projectâ€™s requirements are not known in detail.
