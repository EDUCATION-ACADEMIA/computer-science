<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The basic idea behind this method is to develop a system through repeated cycles (iterative) and in smaller portions at a time (incremental), allowing software developers to take advantage of what was learned during development of earlier parts or versions of the system.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Agile development methodology In all agile methods, teams develop the software in iterations that contain mini-increments of the new functionality.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The Spiral model is mainly used for large projects. It allows development teams to include user feedback early on and create a highly customized product. Another advantage of this SDLC model is how it handles risk management.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The iterative process model is a software development life cycle (SDLC) approach in which the initial development work is conducted based on initial requirements that are clearly defined, and subsequent features are added to this base software product through iterations until the final system is completed.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The Waterfall model is regarded as the traditional software development strategy where the project is divided into unique stages or events that have to be completed sequentially.
