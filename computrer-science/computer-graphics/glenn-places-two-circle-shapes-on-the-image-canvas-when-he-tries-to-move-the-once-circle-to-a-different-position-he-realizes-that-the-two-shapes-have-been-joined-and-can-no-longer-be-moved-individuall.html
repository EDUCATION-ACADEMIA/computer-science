<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-Glenn places two circle shapes on the image canvas. When he tries to move the once circle to a different position, he realizes that the two shapes have been joined and can no longer be moved individually. What is the most likely reason that this occurred? The shapes were drawn on the same layer.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The Magic Wand tool selects pixels within a similar color range with one click. You specify the color range, or tolerance, for the Magic Wand tool’s selection. Use the Magic Wand tool when you have an area of similar colors, like a blue sky.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The Constrain Proportions option lets you maintain the aspect ratio (the ratio of image width to image height). If you select this option and change the image size and resolution, the image does not stretch or shrink.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Raster Images These are the types of images that are produced when scanning or photographing an object. Raster images are compiled using pixels, or tiny dots, containing unique color and tonal information that come together to create the image. Since raster images are pixel based, they are resolution dependent.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The Rectangular Marquee tool is used to make rectangular and square selections. Click and drag to make a rectangular selection. If you want to constrain the selection to be a square, press the Shift key as you’re dragging. The Elliptical Marquee tool is used to make oval and circle selections.
