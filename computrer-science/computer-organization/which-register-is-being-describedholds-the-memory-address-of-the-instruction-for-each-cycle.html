<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The program counter, PC, is a special-purpose register that is used by the processor to hold the address of the next instruction to be executed.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The correct answer is Program counter. Program Counter: A program counter (PC) is a CPU register in the computer processor which has the address of the next instruction to be executed from memory.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-In a computer, the memory address register (MAR) is the CPU register that either stores the memory address from which data will be fetched to the CPU registers, or the address to which data will be sent and stored via system bus.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-The memory address register (MAR) or address buffer also stores the address that references memory.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The correct answer is Memory Buffer Register. Memory Buffer Register holds the contents of data or instruction read from, or written in memory.
