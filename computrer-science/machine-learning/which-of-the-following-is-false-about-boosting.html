<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-26) When you use the boosting algorithm you always consider the weak learners. Which of the following is the main reason for having weak learners? To prevent overfitting, since the complexity of the overall learner increases at each step.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Q17) Which of the following is not possible in a boosting algorithm? Increase in training error.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Which of the following is/are true about boosting trees? In boosting tree individual weak learners are not independent of each other because each tree correct the results of previous tree. Bagging and boosting both can be consider as improving the base learners results.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Each tree is called a “weak learner” for their high bias. XGBoost starts by creating a first simple tree which has poor performance by itself. It then builds another tree which is trained to predict what the first tree was not able to, and is itself a weak learner too.
