<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW

</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-A directed graph, also called a digraph, is a graph in which the edges have a direction. This is usually indicated with an arrow on the edge; more formally, if v and w are vertices, an edge is an unordered pair v, w, while a directed edge, called an arc, is an ordered pair (v, w) or (w, v).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-In mathematics, and more specifically in graph theory, a directed graph (or digraph) is a graph that is made up of a set of vertices connected by directed edges, often called arcs.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-A directed graph is graph, i.e., a set of objects (called vertices or nodes) that are connected together, where all the edges are directed from one vertex to another. A directed graph is sometimes called a digraph or a directed network.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-All the edges in a graph must be either DIRECTED or UNDIRECTED. The two types of edges cannot be mixed together. A graph that uses only DIRECTED EDGES is called a DIRECTED GRAPH. Likewise, a graph that uses only UNDIRECTED EDGES is called an UNDIRECTED GRAPH.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-A directed graph (or digraph) is a set of nodes connected by edges, where the edges have a direction associated with them. For example, an arc (x, y) is considered to be directed from x to y, and the arc (y, x) is the inverted link. Y is a direct successor of x, and x is a direct predecessor of y.
