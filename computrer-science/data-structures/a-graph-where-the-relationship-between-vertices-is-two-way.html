<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-A graph in this context is made up of vertices (also called nodes or points) which are connected by edges (also called links or lines). A distinction is made between undirected graphs, where edges link two vertices symmetrically, and directed graphs, where edges link two vertices asymmetrically.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Forest. A forest is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by at most one path. Equivalently, a forest is an undirected acyclic graph. Equivalently, a forest is an undirected graph, all of whose connected components are trees; in other words, the graph consists of a disjoint union of trees.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-An undirected graph is sometimes called an undirected network. In contrast, a graph where the edges point in a direction is called a directed graph. When drawing an undirected graph, the edges are typically drawn as lines between pairs of nodes, as illustrated in the following figure.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Undirected graphs have edges that do not have a direction. The edges indicate a two-way relationship, in that each edge can be traversed in both directions.
