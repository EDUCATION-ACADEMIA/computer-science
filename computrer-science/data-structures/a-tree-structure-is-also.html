<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-A tree is an undirected graph G that satisfies any of the following equivalent conditions: G is connected and acyclic (contains no cycles). G is acyclic, and a simple cycle is formed if any edge is added to G. G is connected, but would become disconnected if any single edge is removed from G.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-A tree is a connected graph with no cycles. A forest is a graph with each connected component a tree. A leaf in a tree is any vertex of degree 1.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-A connected acyclic graph is called a tree. In other words, a connected graph with no cycles is called a tree. The edges of a tree are known as branches.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Definition: A tree is a connected graph without any cycles, or a tree is a connected acyclic graph. The edges of a tree are called branches. It follows immediately from the definition that a tree has to be a simple graph (because self-loops and parallel edges both form cycles).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-A graph without cycles is called an acyclic graph.
