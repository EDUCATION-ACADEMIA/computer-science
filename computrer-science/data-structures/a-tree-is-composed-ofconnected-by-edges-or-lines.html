<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-A tree structure consists of nodes connected by edges.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-The edges of a tree are known as branches. Elements of trees are called their nodes. The nodes without child nodes are called leaf nodes. A tree with ‘n’ vertices has ‘n-1’ edges. If it has one more edge extra than ‘n-1’, then the extra edge should obviously has to pair up with two vertices which leads to form a cycle.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-Nodes are connected by edges . Each node contains a value or data, and it may or may not have a child node . The first node of the tree is called the root . If this root node is connected by another node, the root is then a parent node and the connected node is a child .
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-It consists of a central node, structural nodes, and sub-nodes, which are connected via edges. We can also say that tree data structure has roots, branches, and leaves connected with one another.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-Path. In a tree data structure, the sequence of Nodes and Edges from one node to another node is called as PATH between that two Nodes. Length of a Path is total number of nodes in that path. In below example the path A-B-E-J has length 4.
