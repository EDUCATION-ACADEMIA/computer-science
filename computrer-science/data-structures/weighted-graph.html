<strong> Weighted graph 
</strong>
<p>(A) ** a graph that has a data value labelled on each edge. 
</p>
<p>(B) The underlying mathematical principles behind the use of graphs. 
</p>
<p>(C) An object in a graph. Also know as a node (vertices is the plural). 
</p>
<p>(D) A join (relationship) between two nodes-sometimes called an edge.

<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-A WEIGHTED EDGE is like a tollway; it costs a certain amount to travel along that edge in either direction. An UNWEIGHTED EDGE, on the other hand, is like a freeway. It costs nothing to travel along that edge. Like Directed and Undirected edges, you cannot mix Weighted and Unweighted Edges.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-A weighted graph is a graph such that each edge is labeled with a number, called the weight of that edge.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The weight of an edge is often referred to as the “cost” of the edge. In applications, the weight may be a measure of the length of a route, the capacity of a line, the energy required to move between locations along a route, etc.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-Definition: A graph having a weight, or number, associated with each edge. Some algorithms require all weights to be nonnegative, integral, positive, etc. Also known as edge-weighted graph.
