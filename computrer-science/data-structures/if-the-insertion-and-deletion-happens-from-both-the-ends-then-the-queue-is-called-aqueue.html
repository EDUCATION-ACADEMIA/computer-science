<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>

<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-The insertion in a linear queue must happen from the rear end and deletion from the front end. But, in deque, you can perform both insertion and deletion operations at both of its ends. Thatâ€™s why it is called a Double-Ended Queue (Deque).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-Double ended Queue: Double Ended Queue is also a Queue data structure in which the insertion and deletion operations are performed at both the ends (front and rear).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-The insertion of an element in a queue is called an enqueue operation and the deletion of an element is called a dequeue operation.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-A double-ended queue is a special type of data in the field of computer programming. In this abstract data type, elements can be added from both the front and the back of the queue. Due to this property, it is also known as a head-tail linked list.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-A dequeue in data structure is a linear data structure that does not follow the FIFO rule (First in first out), that is, in a dequeue data structure, the data can be inserted and deleted from both front and rear ends. However, in a queue, we may only insert and remove data from one end.
