<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-A full binary tree (sometimes proper binary tree or 2-tree ) is a tree in which every node other than the leaves has two children. A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-A binary tree where every node has 0 or 2 children, and all levels except possibly the last are full, then this is called a complete binary tree.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-A full binary tree.is a binary tree in which each node has exactly zero or two children. A complete binary tree is a binary tree, which is completely filled, with the possible exception of the bottom level, which is filled from left to right.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-A full binary tree is a binary tree in which all of the nodes have either 0 or 2 offspring. In other terms, a full binary tree is a binary tree in which all nodes, except the leaf nodes, have two offspring. Then, The number of leaves is (i + 1).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-The nodes from the original tree are internal nodes, and the special nodes are external nodes. In the extended binary tree, all the internal nodes have exactly two children, and the external nodes are leaf nodes.
