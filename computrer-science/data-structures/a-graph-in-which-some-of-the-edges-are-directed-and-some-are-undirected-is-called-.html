<h3>EXPLANATIONS BELOW
</h3>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-1:
</strong>-This is the combination of both the directed graph and undirected graph i.e. A Graph G is called a mixed graph if some of the edges in a graph are directed and some are undirected.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-2:
</strong>-In graph theory, a mixed graph G = (V, E, A) is a graph consisting of a set of vertices V, a set of (undirected) edges E, and a set of directed edges (or arcs) A.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-3:
</strong>-A mixed graph is a graph with edges and arcs, which can be considered as a hybrid of an undirected graph and a directed graph. In this paper we define the mixed adjacency matrix and the mixed energy of a mixed graph.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-4:
</strong>-All the edges in a graph must be either DIRECTED or UNDIRECTED. The two types of edges cannot be mixed together. A graph that uses only DIRECTED EDGES is called a DIRECTED GRAPH. Likewise, a graph that uses only UNDIRECTED EDGES is called an UNDIRECTED GRAPH.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Concept note-5:
</strong>-In mathematics, and more specifically in graph theory, a multigraph is a graph which is permitted to have multiple edges (also called parallel edges), that is, edges that have the same end nodes. Thus two vertices may be connected by more than one edge.
